<h4>Transcriber's Notes</h4>

<p>This book contains material in multiple languages, and numerous
examples of archaic, non-standard and dialect forms of English.
Therefore no attempts to standardize spelling would be appropriate. The
only changes made to the text are to correct typographical errors etc.
which are listed at <a href="#Transcribers_Notes">the end of the book</a>. Minor corrections to format or
punctuation have been made without comment.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been numbered sequentially throughout the book but are
presented at the end of each section or ballad to which they refer.</p>

<p>Special characters:</p>

<p>[asterism] represents an asterism of 3 stars</p>

<p class="center">NUMBERS 83-113</p>


<p>Upon concluding this Fourth Part, I have to express warm thanks to Mr <span class="smcap">James
Barclay Murdoch</span> for a punctilious recollation of <span class="smcap">Motherwell's</span> manuscript, and to Mr
<span class="smcap">Malcolm Colquhoun Thomson</span> for again granting the use of the volume. Miss <span class="smcap">Mary
Fraser Tytler</span>, to remove a doubt about a few readings, has generously taken the trouble
to make a fac-simile copy of <span class="smcap">Alexander Fraser Tytler's Brown</span> manuscript. Mr
<span class="smcap">Macmath</span>, whose accuracy is not surpassed by photographic reproduction, has done me favors
of a like kind, and of many kinds. Rev. Professor <span class="smcap">Skeat</span>, with all his engagements, has
been prompt to render his peculiarly valuable help at the libraries of Cambridge; and Mr
<span class="smcap">F. H. Stoddard</span>, late of Oxford, now of the University of California, has allowed me to call
upon him freely for copies and collations at the Bodleian Library. The notes which Dr
<span class="smcap">Reinhold KÃ¶hler</span>, Professor <span class="smcap">Felix Liebricht</span>, Professor <span class="smcap">C. R. Lanman</span>, and Mr <span class="smcap">George
Lyman Kittredge</span> have contributed, in the way of Additions and Corrections, will speak
for themselves. Miss <span class="smcap">Isabel Florence Hapgood</span>, translator of the Epic Songs of Russia,
has given me much assistance in Slavic popular poetry, and Lieutenant-Colonel <span class="smcap">W. F. Prideaux</span>,
of Calcutta, Mr <span class="smcap">Frank Kidson</span>, of Leeds, and Mr <span class="smcap">P. Z. Round</span>, of London, have
made obliging communications as to English ballads.</p>

THE CHERRY-TREE CAROL</h2>

<p>The proper story of this highly popular
carol is derived from the Pseudo-Matthew's
gospel, chapter <span class="smcap">xx</span>; Tischendorf, Evangelia
Apocrypha, p. 82; Thilo, Codex Apocryphus
Novi Testamenti, Historia de Nativitate MariÃ¦
et de Infantia Salvatoris, p. 395. What
succeeds, after <b>A</b> 9, <b>B</b> 8, <b>C</b> 7, <b>D</b> 6, is probably
founded on the angel's words to the shepherds
in Luke ii, and on Jesus's predictions in
the authentic gospels. This latter portion is
sometimes printed as an independent carol,
under the title of 'Joseph and the Angel.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>On the third day of the flight into Egypt,
Mary, feeling the heat to be oppressive, tells
Joseph that she will rest for a while under a
palm-tree. Joseph helps her to light from
her beast, and Mary, looking up from under
the tree, and seeing it full of fruit, asks for
some. Joseph somewhat testily expresses his
surprise that she should think of such a thing,
considering the height of the tree: he is much
more concerned to get a supply of water.
Then Jesus, sitting on his mother's lap, bids
the palm to bow down and refresh his mother
with its fruit. The palm instantly bends its
top to Mary's feet.</p>

<p>The truly popular carol would be sure to
adapt the fruit to its own soil. In English
the tree is always a cherry. We have the
story also in the fifteenth of the Coventry
Mysteries, ed. Halliwell, p. 146 (not omitting
Joseph's quip in <b>A</b> 5, etc.), with the addition
of a little more miracle: for it is not the season
for cherries, and Mary's wish is anticipated
by the tree's blooming before she has
uttered it. In Catalan and ProvenÃ§al the
tree is an apple. On the way from Bethlehem
to Nazareth, Mary and Joseph come upon a
gardener who is climbing an apple-tree, and
Mary asks for an apple. He politely gives
her leave to pluck for herself. Joseph, who
this time has not been disobliging, tries, but
the branches go up; Mary tries, and the
branches come to her:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> MilÃ¡, Romancerillo, p.
3, No 4. Also p. 63, No 55, where again Joseph
is <i>molt fellÃ³</i>, very crusty; further, Briz,
III, 228; Arbaud, Chants populaires de la
Provence, 'Lou premier Miracle,' I, 23, and
'La Fuito en Egypto,' II, 237 f. In other legendary
ballads, not so entirely popular, the
palm-tree is preserved: Meinert, p. 262; BÃ¶hme,
p. 628, No 523=Weinhold, Weihnachtspiele,
p. 385; Lexer, KÃ¤rntisches WÃ¶rterbuch,
p. 310; Feifalik, Die Kindheit Jesu, pp 101,
106=Pailler, Weihnachtlieder aus OberÃ¶sterreich,
No 314, p 338 f; Pailler, p. 332, No
310; Hoffmann, HorÃ¦ BelgicÃ¦, Part Ten,
p. 59; Alberdingk Thijm, I, 212. In Schmitz,
Sitten und Sagen des Eifler Volkes, I, 116, and
Pailler, as above, No 311, we have a fig-tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-2" id="Pg_2-2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Some of these are very imperfect, or have even
lost chief points in the story.</p>

<p>There are many narratives of the childhood
of Jesus, based on the apocryphal gospels, in
which this legend must needs be found: as,
Cursor Mundi, ed. Morris, II, 668 f, v. 11,657
ff; Horstmann, Altenglische Legenden, 1875,
p. 6, 1878, pp 102, 112; Stephens, Fornsvenskt
Legendarium, p. 71; PitrÃ©, Canti popolari siciliani,

THE CARNAL AND THE CRANE</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

Carols, p. 152, Christmastide, p. 246, from a broadside.
<b>b.</b> Husk, Songs of the Nativity, p. 97, apparently

<p>Mr Husk, who had access to a remarkably
good collection of carols, afterwards unfortunately
dispersed, had met with no copy of
'The Carnal and the Crane' of earlier date
than the middle of the last century. Internal
evidence points us much further back. The
carol had obviously been transmitted from
mouth to mouth before it was fixed in its present
incoherent and corrupted form by print.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The well-informed Crane instructs his catechumen,
the Crow, in several matters pertaining
to the birth and earliest days of Jesus:
the Immaculate Conception; the Nativity; the
conference of Herod with the Wise Men, including
the miracle of the roasted cock; the
Flight into Egypt, with the Adoration of the
Beasts and the Instantaneous Harvest; the
Massacre of the Innocents. Of the apocryphal
incidents, the miracle of the cock, sts 10, 11,
has been spoken of under No 22. The adoration
of the beasts, sts 15, 16, is derived from
the Historia de Nativitate MariÃ¦, etc. (Pseudo-MatthÃ¦i
Evangelium), c. 19, Thilo, p. 394,
Tischendorf, p. 81, and is of course frequent in
legendaries of the infancy of the Saviour,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but
is not remarkable enough to be popular in
carols. The miraculous harvest, by which
the Holy Family evade Herod's pursuit, is, on
the contrary, a favorite subject with popular
poetry, as also, like the bowing of the palm-tree,
with pictorial art. I do not know where
and when this pretty and clever legend was invented.
In the Greek Gospel of Thomas, ch.
12, Jesus sows one grain of wheat, in the
Latin Gospel of Thomas, ch. 10, and ch. 34 of
the Pseudo-Matthew, a very little, and reaps an
immense crop at harvest time; Tischendorf, pp
143 f, 165 f, 97: but this passage would hardly
even suggest the miracle in question.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In a
Swedish carol, 'Staffans-Visan,' reprinted from
a recent broadside, in Dansk Kirketidende,
1861, cols 35, 36, by Professor George Stephens,
and afterwards by Grundtvig, Danmarks
Folkeviser, III, 882, the legend of the Cock
and that of the Sower are combined, as here.
The legend of the Sower is followed by that
of the Palm-tree, and others, in La Fuito en
Egypto, Arbaud, Chants p. de la Provence, II,
235. Another ProvenÃ§al version of the Sower
is given by Briz, IV, 70; a Catalan at pp 65
and 68, 'Lo rey Herodes;' ten Catalan versions
by MilÃ¡, 'Herodes,' Romancerillo, pp
6-9, No 10. To these add: 'La Fuite en
Ãgypte,' PoÃ©sies p. de la France, MS., I, fol.
226, 'Le roi HÃ©rode,' VI, 192; 'De Vlucht
naar Egypten,' Lootens et Feys, p. 32, No 20,
Hoffmann von Fallersleben, HorÃ¦ BelgicÃ¦,
Part Ten, p. 22, No 4; 'Die Flucht Maria's,'
Haupt und Schmaler, Volkslieder der Wenden,
I, 275, No 283; Bezsonof, Kalyeki Perekhozhie,
II, 116, No 319. The legend of the
Sower occurs also in Le Geu des Trois Roys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-8" id="Pg_2-8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Jubinal, MystÃ¨res inÃ©dits du 15<sup>e</sup> SiÃ¨cle, II,

<p>It is ordinarily Mary, and not Jesus, who
operates the miracle; in the French mystery
it is perhaps Joseph.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In the ProvenÃ§al and

behind a sheaf or a stack, and does not pass

its leaves so as to afford no concealment. For this
the mint is cursed; though it flower, it shall not seed. The
good man then tells them to hide under sage; the sage
stretches itself out to cover them. The mint betrays the Virgin
in many of the Catalan ballads: She is under the stack!
The salvia answers in MilÃ¡, <b>C</b>, 'ment la menta y mentirÃ¡.'
In <b>D</b> parsley is the good plant: the mint is cursed
with barrenness as before. In MilÃ¡, <b>J</b>, the partridge (one

DIVES AND LAZARUS</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_56_A">A</a>.</b> 'Dives and Lazarus.' <b>a.</b> Sylvester's Christmas
Carols, p. 50. <b>b.</b> Husk, Songs of the Nativity, p. 94.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_56_B">B</a>.</b> 'Diverus and Lazarus,' F. S. L., in Notes and
Queries, Fourth Series, III, 76.</p></div>

<p>A ballet "of the Ryche man and poor
Lazarus" was licensed to Master John Wallye
and Mistress Toye, 19 July, 1557-9 July,
1558. W. Pekerynge pays his license for
printing "of a ballett, Dyves and Lazarus,"
22 July, 1570-22 July, 1571. Arber, Registers
of the Company of Stationers, I, 76,
436. A fiddler in Fletcher's Monsieur Thomas,
printed 1639, says he can sing The merry ballad
of Diverus and Lazarus: Act 3, Scene
3, Dyce, VII, 364. The name Diverus is preserved
in <b>C</b>, and F. S. L., who contributed
this copy to Notes and Queries, had heard only
Diverus, never Dives. Dr Rimbault, Notes
and Queries, as above, p. 157, had never met
with Diverus. Hone cites two stanzas, <b>a</b> 10,
<b>b</b> 11, nearly, in his Ancient Mysteries, p. 95,
and Sandys the last three stanzas, nearly as
in <b>a</b>, in Notes and Queries, p. 157, as above.
A copy in Bramley and Stainer's Christmas
Carols, p. 85, seems to have been made up
from Sylvester's and another copy. The few
variations are probably arbitrary.</p>

<p>The subject could not escape the popular
muse: e. g., Socard, NoÃ«ls et Cantiques imprimÃ©s
Ã  Troyes, Histoire de Lazare et du
Mauvais Riche, p. 118 ff; 'El mal rico,' MilÃ¡,
Romancerillo, p. 16, No 16, <b>A-F</b>; 'Lazarus,'
Des DÃ¼lkener Fiedlers Liederbuch, p. 53, No
63; 'Lazar a bohatec,' Su&#353;il, MoravskÃ© NÃ¡rodnÃ­
PÃ­sn&#277;, p. 19, No 18, Wenzig, Bibliothek
Slavischer Poesien, p. 114; Bezsonof, Kalyeki
Perekhozhie, I, 43-97, Nos 19-27.</p>

<p>There is a very beautiful ballad, in which
the Madonna takes the place of Lazarus, in
Roadside Songs of Tuscany, Francesca Alexander
and John Ruskin, 'La Madonna e il
Riccone,' p. 82.</p>

BROWN ROBYNÂ´S CONFESSION</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 110. Motherwell's MS., p. 580.</p></div>


<p>The only known version of 'Brown Robyn's
Confession' is the one printed in Ballads
of the North of Scotland, the copy in Motherwell's
MS. having been derived from Buchan.</p>

<p>The ballad, as we have it in English, celebrates
a miracle of the Virgin, and is our only
example of that extensive class of legends,
unless we choose to include 'The Jew's
Daughter,' and to take Robin Hood's view of
the restoration of his loan, in the fourth Fit
of the Little Gest. Of rescues on the sea, by
which Mary "vere maris stella indiciis evidentissimis
comprobatur," we have two in
most of the collections of the Virgin's miracles,
e. g., Vincent of Beauvais, 1. <span class="smcap">VII</span>, cc 88,89,
Gautier de Coincy, ed. Poquet, pp 515, 605.
The deliverance, however, <i>is</i> for honor done
to Mary, and <i>not</i> for a fair confession.</p>

<p>A fine ballad, very common in Sweden, and
preserved by tradition also in Denmark and
Norway, has the same story with a tragical
termination for the hero, saving a single instance,
in which there is also a supernatural
interference in his behalf.</p>

the story of these ballads is this. Sir Peter
asks his foster-mother what death he shall die.
You are not to die in your bed, she says, and
not in fight, but beware of the waves. Peter
cares not for the waves, and builds a splendid
ship, the hulk and masts of whalebone (elm,
Swedish <b>D</b>; walnut, Norwegian, Danish <b>D</b>),
the flags of gold (oars, Danish <b>A</b>). Let us
drink to-day, while we have ale, says Peter;
to-morrow we will sail where gain shall guide.
The skipper and helmsman push off, forgetful
of God the Father, God's Son, and the Holy
Ghost. They sail a year or two on the boiling
sea, and when they come where water is
deepest the masts begin to go, Swedish <b>A</b>;
the ship stops, Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, Norwegian,
Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> will not mind her helm,
Danish <b>B</b>. They cast lots to see who is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-14" id="Pg_2-14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
sinner; the skipper and captain do this while
Peter is in his cabin sleeping,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in Swedish
<b>D</b>, Norwegian, Danish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. The lot falls on
Peter. He makes his shrift, since there is no
priest, before the mast (which, with the yard,
forms a cross), Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian,
Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; before an oar, on which Our
Lord stands written, Danish <b>A</b>. "Churches
have I plundered, and convents have I burned,
and stained the honor of many a noble maid.
I have roamed the woods and done both robbery
and murder, and many an honest peasant's
son buried alive in the earth:" Swedish
<b>A</b>. He then says his last words, Danish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
and nearly all.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If any of you should get back to land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my foster-mother ask for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell her I'm serving in the king's court,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Danish <b>C</b>, they throw Peter
over, on the larboard in the first, and the
ship resumes her course; in Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>,
he wraps a cloak round him and jumps in
himself; in Swedish <b>A</b> the ship goes down.
In Danish <b>B</b> Jon RimaardssÃ¸n binds three
bags about him, saying, He shall never die
poor that will bury my body.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It was a sad
sight to see when he made a cross on the blue
wave, and so took the wild path that lay to
the sea's deep bottom. Sir Peter, in Danish
<b>A</b>, made this cross and was ready to take this
path; but when he reached the water the wild
sea turned to green earth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sir Peter took horse, the ship held her course,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So glad they coasted the strand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And very glad was his true-love too<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That he had come to land.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No explanation is offered of this marvel. In
the light of the Scottish ballad, we should
suppose that Sir Peter's deliverance in Danish
<b>A</b> was all for the fair confession he made upon
the sea.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Saxo relates that, in the earlier part of
Thorkill's marvellous voyage, the crews of his
three ships, when reduced almost to starving,
coming upon an island well stocked with
herds, would not heed the warning of their
commander, that if they took more than sufficed
to mitigate their immediate sufferings
they might be estopped from proceeding by the
local divinities, but loaded the vessels with
carcasses. During the night which followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-15" id="Pg_2-15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the ships were beset by a crowd of monsters,
the biggest of whom advanced into the water,
armed with a huge club, and called out to the
seafarers that they would not be allowed to
sail off till they had expiated the offence they
had committed by delivering up one man for
each ship. Thorkill, for the general safety,
surrendered three men, selected by lot, after
which they had a good wind and sailed on.
Book <span class="smcap">VIII</span>; p. 161, ed. 1644.</p>

<p>King Half on his way home from a warlike
expedition encountered so violent a storm that
his ship was nigh to foundering. A resolution
was taken that lots should be cast to determine
who should jump overboard. But no
lots were needed, says the saga (implying, by
the way, that a vicarious atonement was sufficient),
for the men vied with one another
who should go overboard for his comrade.
Fornaldar SÃ¶gur, Rafn, II, 37 f.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>A very pretty Little-Russian <i>duma</i>, or ballad,
also shows the efficacy of confession in such a
crisis: 'The Storm on the Black Sea,' Maksimovitch,
Songs of Ukraine, p. 14, Moscow,
1834, p. 48, Kief, 1849; translated by Bodenstedt,
Die poetische Ukraine, p. 118. The
Cossack flotilla has been divided by a storm
on the Black Sea, and two portions of it have
gone to wreck. In the third sails the hetman.
He walks his deck in sombre composure, and
says to the sailors, Some offence has been
done, and this makes the sea so wild: confess
then your sins to God, to the Black Sea, and
to me your hetman; the guilty man shall die,
and the fleet of the Cossacks not perish. The
Cossacks stand silent, for no one knows who
is guilty, when lo, Alexis, son of the priest
of Piriatin, steps forth and says, Let me be
the sacrifice; bind a cloth round my eyes, a
stone about my neck, and throw me in; so
shall the fleet of the Cossacks not perish.
The men are astounded: how can a heavy sin
be resting on Alexis, who reads them the
sacred books, whose example has kept them
from wickedness! Alexis left home, he says,
without asking his father's and mother's blessing,
and with an angry threat against his
brother; he wrenched the last crust of bread
from his neighbors; he rode along the street
wantonly spurning the breasts of women and
the foreheads of children; he passed churches
without uncovering, without crossing himself:
and now he must die for his sins. As he
makes this shrift the storm begins to abate;
to the amazement of the Cossacks, the fleet is
saved, and not one man drowned.</p>

<p>The rich merchant Sadko, the very entertaining
hero of several Russian popular epics,
is nowhere more entertaining than when, during
one of his voyages, his ship comes to a stop
in the sea. He thinks he has run upon a rock
or sand-bank, and tries to push off, but the
vessel is immovable. Twelve years we have
been sailing, says Sadko, and never paid tribute
to the king of the sea. A box of gold is
thrown in as a peace-offering, but floats like a
duck. It is clear that the sea-king wants no
toll; he requires a man. Every man is ordered
to make a lot from pine-wood and write
his name on it. These lots are thrown into
the sea. Every one of them swims like a
duck but Sadko's, and his goes down like a
stone. That is not the proper wood for a lot,
says Sadko: make lots of fir-wood. Fir lots
are tried: Sadko's goes down like a stone, the
rest swim like ducks. Fir is not right, either;
alder, oak, are tried with the same result. We
are quite wrong, says Sadko; we must take
cypress, for cypress was the wood of the cross.
They try cypress, and still Sadko's lot sinks,
while all the others float. I am the man, says
Sadko. He orders his men to get for him an
oblation of silver, gold, and pearls, and with
this, taking an image of St Nicholas in one
hand and his gusli in the other, commits himself
to the sea, and goes down like a stone.
But not to drown. It was quite worth his
while for the rare adventures that followed.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-16" id="Pg_2-16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>The casting of lots to find out the guilty
man who causes trouble to a ship occurs in
William Guiseman, Kinloch's Ancient Scottish
Ballads, p. 156, Kinloch MSS, V, 43, a
copy, improved by tradition, of the "lament"
in 'William Grismond's Downfal,' a broadside
of 1650, which is transcribed among the Percy
papers, from Ballard's collection.</p>

<p>Captain Glen is thrown overboard without
a lot, on the accusation of the boatswain, and
with the happiest effect; broadside in the
Roxburghe collection, Logan's Pedlar's Pack,
p. 47, Kinloch MSS, V, 278.</p>

<p>Stanzas of <b>E</b> and of <b>L</b>, a little altered, are
given by Motherwell in his Introduction, pp
xlv, xlvi. The ballad in the Border Minstrelsy,
<b>H</b>, was made up from two versions, the
better of which was <b>G</b>, and five stanzas, 16-20,
recited by Mr Hamilton, sheriff of Lanarkshire.
Mr Hamilton is said to have got
his fragment "from an old nurse, a retainer
of the Gilkerscleugh family," when himself
a boy, about the middle of the last century.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The copy in Finlay's Scottish Ballads, I, 49,
is Scott's, with the last stanza exchanged for
the last of <b>A</b>, and one or two trifling changes.
The imperfect copies <b>K</b>, stanzas 6-10, <b>M</b> 1,
3, show admixture with the more modern ballad
of 'Young Allan.' <b>L</b> 1, with variations,
is found in 'Fair Annie of Lochroyan,' Herd,
1776, I, 150, and may not belong here. But
ballad-ships are wont to be of equal splendor
with Cleopatra's galley: see, for a first-rate,
the Scandinavian 'Sir Peter's Voyage,' cited
in the preface to '<a href="#Ballad_57">Brown Robyn's Confession.</a>'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>This admired and most admirable ballad is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-18" id="Pg_2-18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
one of many which were first made known to
the world through Percy's Reliques. Percy's
version remains, poetically, the best. It may
be a fragment, but the imagination easily
supplies all that may be wanting; and if more
of the story, or the whole, be told in <b>H</b>, the
half is better than the whole.</p>

<p>The short and simple story in <b>A-F</b> is that
the king wants a good sailor to take command
of a ship or ships ready for sea. Sir Patrick
Spens<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> is recommended, and the king sends
him a commission. This good sailor is much
elated by receiving a letter from the king,
but the contents prove very unwelcome.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He
would hang the man that praised his seamanship,
if he knew him, <b>B</b>; though it had been
the queen herself, she might have let it be, <b>F</b>;
had he been a better man, he might ha tauld a
lee, <b>D</b>. The objection, as we learn from <b>A</b> 5,
<b>C</b> 5, is the bad time of year. Percy cites a law
of James III, forbidding ships to be freighted
out of the realm with staple goods between the
feast of Simon and Jude and Candlemas, October
28-February 2. There is neither choice
nor thought, but prompt obedience to orders.
The ship must sail the morn, and this without
regard to the fearful portent of the new moon
having been seen <i>late</i> yestreen with the auld
moon in her arm. They are only a few
leagues out when a furious storm sets in. The
captain calls for a boy to take the steer in
hand while he goes to the topmast to spy land,
<b>B</b>; or, more sensibly, sends up the boy, and
sticks to the rudder, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>. The report is not
encouraging, or is not waited for, for the sea
has everything its own way, and now the
nobles, who were loath to wet their shoes, are
overhead in water, and now fifty fathoms
under. It would be hard to point out in ballad
poetry, or other, happier and more refined
touches than the two stanzas in <b>A</b> which portray
the bootless waiting of the ladies for the
return of the seafarers.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In <b>G-J</b> we meet with additional circumstances.
The destination of the ship is Norway.
The object of the voyage is not told
in <b>G</b>; in <b>H</b> it is to bring home the king of
Norway's daughter; in <b>J</b> to bring home the
Scottish king's daughter; in <b>I</b> to take out the
Scottish king's daughter to Norway, where
she is to be queen. The Scots make the passage
in two days, or three, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>. After a
time the Norwegians begin to complain of the
expense caused by their guests, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>; or reproach
the Scots with staying too long, to their
own king's cost, <b>I</b>. Sir Patrick tells them
that he brought money enough to pay for
himself and his men, and says that nothing
shall induce him to stay another day in the
country. It is now that we have the omen of
the new moon with the old moon in her arm,
in <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. In <b>I</b> this comes before the voyage
to Norway,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and in <b>G</b> the stanza expressing
apprehension of a storm, without the reason,
occurs twice,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> before the voyage out as well
as before the return voyage. In <b>J</b>, as in <b>A-F</b>,
the ship is lost on the voyage out. In <b>G</b>,
therefore, and <b>I</b> as well, two different accounts
may have been blended.</p>

<p>Whether there is an historical basis for the
shipwreck of Scottish nobles which this ballad
sings, and, if so, where it is to be found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-19" id="Pg_2-19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
are questions that have been considerably
discussed. A strict accordance with history
should not be expected, and indeed would be
almost a ground of suspicion.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Ballad singers
and their hearers would be as indifferent to
the facts as the readers of ballads are now;
it is only editors who feel bound to look closely
into such matters. Motherwell has suggested
a sufficiently plausible foundation. Margaret,
daughter of Alexander III, was married, in
1281, to Eric, King of Norway. She was conducted
to her husband, "brought home," in
August of that year, by many knights and
nobles. Many of these were drowned on the
return voyage,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> as Sir Patrick Spens is in <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>.</p>

<p>Margaret, Eric's queen, died in 1283, leaving
a newly born daughter; and Alexander
III, having been killed by being thrown from
his horse, in 1286, the crown fell to the granddaughter.
A match was proposed between the
infant Margaret, called the Maid of Norway,
and the eldest son of Edward I of England.
A deputation, not so splendid as the train
which accompanied the little maid's mother
to Norway, was sent, in 1290, to bring the
Princess Margaret over, but she died on the
way before reaching Scotland. The Scalacronica
speaks of only a single envoy, Master
Weland, a Scottish clerk. If "the chronicle
will not lie," the Maid of Norway and the
Scottish clerk perished, we must suppose in a
storm, on the coasts of Boghan<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> (Buchan?).
This is not quite enough to make the ballad
out of, and there is still less material in the
marriage of James III with the daughter of
the king of Norway in 1469, and no shipwreck
chronicled at all.</p>

<p>No such name as Patrick Spens is historically
connected with any of these occurrences.
Spens has even been said not to be an early
Scottish name. Aytoun, however, points to a
notable exploit by one Spens as early as 1336,
and Mr Macmath has shown me that the name
occurred in five charters of David II, therefore
between 1329 and 1370. We might allege
that Spens, though called Sir Patrick in
later days, was in reality only a skeely skipper,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
and that historians do not trouble themselves
much about skippers. But this would
be avoiding the proper issue. The actual name
of the hero of a ballad affords hardly a presumption
as to who was originally the hero.
This ballad may be historical, or it may not.
It might be substantially historical though the
command of the ship were invariably given to
Sir Andrew Wood, a distinguished admiral,
who was born a couple of centuries after the
supposed event; and it might be substantially
historical though we could prove that Patrick
Spens was only a shipmaster, of purely local
fame, who was lost off Aberdour a couple of
hundred years ago. For one, I do not feel
compelled to regard the ballad as historical.</p>

<p>A mermaid appears to the navigators in
<b>J</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, and informs them, <b>J</b>, that they
will never see dry land, or are not far from
land, <b>L</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, which, coming from a mermaid,
they are good seamen enough to know means
the same thing. The appearance of a mermaid
to seamen is a signal for despair in a
brief little ballad, of no great antiquity to all
seeming, given further on under the title of
'The Mermaid.' If nothing worse, mermaids
at least bode rough weather, and sailors do not
like to see them: Faye, Norske Folke-Sagn,
ed. 1844, p. 55 (Prior). They have a reputation
for treachery: there is in a Danish ballad,
Grundtvig, II, 91, No 42, <b>B</b> 14, one who
has betrayed seven ships.</p>

<p>The place where the ship went down was
half owre to Aberdour, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>?; ower by
Aberdour, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>N</b>; forty miles off Aberdeen,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b> (<b>H</b> may only repeat <b>G</b>); nore-east, nore-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-20" id="Pg_2-20">[Pg 20]</a></span>west
frae Aberdeen, <b>D</b>; between Leith and
Aberdeen, <b>K</b>. <b>B</b> and <b>E</b> transfer the scene to
St Johnston (Perth), and <b>P</b> to the Clyde,
down below Dumbarton Castle. We may
fairly say, somewhere off the coast of Aberdeenshire,
for the southern Aberdour, in the
Firth of Forth, cannot be meant.</p>

<p>The island of Papa Stronsay is said to be
about half way between Aberdour in Buchan
and the coast of Norway, half owre to Aberdour;
and on this island there is a tumulus,
which Mr Maidment informs us is known now,
and <i>has always been</i> known, as the grave of
Sir Patrick Spens. Nothing more has been
transmitted, we are assured, but only the name
as that of a man buried there: Maidment,
Scotish Ballads and Songs, Historical and
Traditionary, I, 31 f. "The Scottish ballads
were not early current in Orkney, a Scandinavian
country," says Aytoun, "so it is very
unlikely that the poem could have originated
the name." With regard to this Orcadian
grave of Patrick Spens, it may first be remarked
that Barry, who, in 1808, speaks of
the Earl's Knowe in Papa Stronsay, says not
a word of the tradition now affirmed to be of
indefinite long-standing (neither does Tudor in
1883). The ballad has been in print for a
hundred and twenty years. There are Scots
in the island now, and perhaps there "always"
have been; at any rate, a generation
or two is time enough for a story to strike root
and establish itself as tradition.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

SIR ALDINGAR</h2>

<p>This ballad, one of the most important of
all that the Percy manuscript has saved from
oblivion, was first given to the world in the
Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, II, 48,
ed. 1765, II, 49, ed. 1767, with conjectural
emendations by the editor, and the insertion
of some stanzas to complete the story. A second
version, very much humbled in diction,
and otherwise corrupted, but of indubitable
antiquity, as Scott remarks, was published in
the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border in 1803,
as communicated by Mr Williamson Burnet,
of Monboddo, from the recitation of an old
woman. The story which this version relates
was then, we are informed, universally current
in the Mearns, and was supposed to be authenticated
by the sword of the hero, preserved
nearly down to that time by his reputed descendants.</p>

<p>Tales of the same general description&mdash;of a
noble lady accused to her husband of infidelity,
believed by him to be guilty, and in process of
time demonstrated to have been faultless, to
his entire conviction&mdash;are, as might be expected,
extremely often to be met with in ballad,
romance, chronicle, or saga; nor is the
number small of those which have the special
traits that the accusation is made by a trusted
officer of the husband, who has attempted
to seduce the lady, and has failed, and that
the wife is cleared by a judgment of God.
Our ballad belongs with a very distinct Scandinavian
variety of these last, but has adopted
one characteristic trait from another source.</p>

<p>The English version, as written down about
the middle of the seventeenth century, narrates
that Sir Aldingar, steward of King Henry,
repulsed by the queen whom he has sought
to make his paramour, cannot rest till he has
revenge. He takes a lazar that happens to
come to the king's gates, and lays him in the
queen's bed, promising that in two hours the
blind and lame shall be whole and sound; he
then goes to fetch the king. The king, convinced
by his eyes, says he will hang the lazar
and burn his wife, and immediately proceeds
to tell the queen his discovery. The queen
sees the hand of Aldingar in this, and also
the meaning of a dream she has had: how a
vulture, or griffin, had carried her crown away,
and would have taken her to his nest<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> had it
not been for a merlin, a little hawk, that came
flying from the east and struck the big bird
down. She claims the right to maintain her
innocence by battle, and the king gives her
forty days to provide herself with a champion,
which failing she shall be burnt. No man in
all the south country will undertake her cause,
but a messenger who rides into the east meets
what seems to be a child, who interrogates
him, and, getting a slow answer, bids the
queen by him to remember her dream and be
of good cheer, for when bale is highest boot
shall be nighest. The days of grace being
out, and no champion found, the queen is put
into a tun to burn, and looks only for death.
At this moment a child is seen riding from
the east, who, when he comes to the fire, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-34" id="Pg_2-34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ders
the brands to be withdrawn and Aldingar
to be produced. Aldingar, a very large
man, would not have minded fifty such. The
child claims the first stroke, and if Aldingar
can give a second he need not spare him. Aldingar's
legs are cut off at the knee with this
stroke. Aldingar asks for a priest to shrive
him, confesses everything, and begs the
queen's forgiveness. The child enjoins King
Harry to take back his wife and love her, for
she is true as stone; the lazar under the gallows
becomes a sound man at the same instant,
and is made steward in Aldingar's place.</p>

<p>The Scottish ballad repeats the main part
of this story, dropping all that is miraculous
save the simple judgment of God. Rodingham,
who represents Aldingar, does not cajole
the leper with the promise of being restored
to health, but intoxicates him with sweet liquors,
and lays him asleep in the queen's bed.
The king wishes to believe the queen guiltless,
and proposes that she shall find a champion.
The champion is an ordinary knight;
the leper is neither better nor worse for the
part he is made to play; and the knight is rewarded
with a gift of lands. That the Scottish
ballad is the original of the English is a
singularly unhappy idea of Sir Walter Scott's,
and it is hard to conceive what suggested such
a notion, unless it were the allegation that the
sword with which Sir Hugh defended the
queen's honor was until a late day producible
by his posterity, whereas no one pretends to
have the other. But Sir Walter could not
seriously have credited this tradition, for he
himself observes that there is no instance in
history in which the honor of a queen of Scotland
was committed to the chance of a duel.</p>

<p>Cousin to the English ballad is the Scandinavian
'Ravengaard og Memering,' Grundtvig,
No 13, I, 177-213, 426 f, II, 640-45, III, 779-82,
IV, 722-31. There are eleven versions
in all, besides a <b>Norwegian</b> copy, extant at
the end of the last century, of which now only
the story is at our command. Eight of the
eleven texts are <b>Danish</b>, <b>A-C</b>, <b>G-L</b>. <b>A</b> is
from a manuscript of the middle of the sixteenth
century, and so a hundred years older
than 'Sir Aldingar.' The other Danish copies
are from recent tradition,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and so are <b>FÃ¤rÃ¶e</b>
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. An <b>Icelandic</b> version, <b>F</b>, is from a
seventeenth-century manuscript.</p>

<p>The old Danish ballad affords the following
story. Gunild [Gunder] lives at Spire,
and many nobles from all quarters of the compass
sue for her hand, which Henry, Duke of
Brunswick and Schleswig, obtains. Henry,
going to the wars, commits to Ravengaard the
protection of his land, and especially of his
wife. But no sooner is the duke fairly away
than Ravengaard goes to "the queen," and
demands of her the sword Adelring, which
she has in keeping. This being refused, Ravengaard
threatens that he will tell false tales
of her, but the lady is not intimidated. The
duke comes home, and asks Ravengaard how
things are. The country remains as it was,
but Gunild has been acting ill. The duke
will not believe anything wrong of Gunild;
but Ravengaard affirms that he has seen the
archbishop with her with his own eyes. Henry,
after repeating this charge to Gunild,
beats her severely, and nobody dares come to
the rescue, or to speak for her, save two ladies
of the court, who maintain that Ravengaard
has lied. Then let her find a man who will
fight with him, says the duke. Bare-headed
and bare-foot Gunild goes to the hall where
the knights are drinking. They all rise; but
when she asks, Is there anybody here who
will fight for a woman? there is no response
except from Memering. He had served her
father fifteen years; never had he seen her so
wretched, bare-shouldered, bare-foot. Ravengaard
had had more of her father's bounty
than anybody, and he has been the first to
betray her. Memering had always been last
when gifts were giving; but he will go into
the lists for her if he can have the sword Adelring,
and this Gunild promises him. A ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-35" id="Pg_2-35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
is marked on the ground for the fight. Ravengaard
requires Memering to swear that he
knows not of the sword Adelring. Memering
(who has thrust the blade into the earth)
swears that he does not know of more than
the hilt being above ground, and exacts in
turn that Ravengaard shall swear that he has
no knowledge of the sword Sudevind [Saadering],
to which Ravengaard makes oath without
qualification. With the first blow Ravengaard
cuts Memering's sword in two. This
shows, says the duke, what deeds you have
been doing. Memering strikes, and cuts Ravengaard's
sword in two. Ravengaard asks his
adversary to wait a moment till he can tie his
shoe, stoops, and picks up the sword Sudevind;
for which perjury, says Memering, thy
foul soul is lost. Ravengaard now cuts a second
sword of Memering's in two. Memering
asks for time to tie his shoe, stoops down, and
produces the sword Adelring; for which perjury,
says Ravengaard, thy foul soul is lost.
But Memering had been careful to swear with
circumstance: he had sworn that he knew of
nothing but the hilt being above ground. With
one stroke he cuts Sudevind in two, and with
a second Ravengaard's neck. And now Gunild
may say to the duke, You see Ravengaard
lied. Henry begs forgiveness. Memering,
who has a broken head and leg, demands nothing
more than bread the rest of his days, but
Gunild says she will herself be his leech, and
he shall have both bread to eat and scarlet to
wear.</p>

<p>The trick of reserving a peculiarly formidable
sword is a commonplace in northern
sagas,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and we are not obliged to suppose that
it belonged to the ballad from the beginning.
No trace of it is found in the other Scandinavian
versions.</p>

<p>The Danish versions from recent oral tradition,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G-L</b>, relate that Henry, going off on
an expedition, commits Gunild to the care of
Ravnlil, who forthwith demands that she shall
do his will, otherwise he will tell a great lie
about her. She trusts in the triumph of honesty,
and defies him. Henry comes back, and
inquires of Ravnlil about his wife, and Ravnlil
tells his great lie: Gunild spares neither monk
nor priest; he has seen the archbishop with
her, <b>C</b>. Henry seizes Gunild by the hair,
throws her to the ground and beats her; thus
shall she be served till she find a kemp that
will fight for her. Gunild goes to the kemp-house,
and asks if there is any man that will
fight for a woman. None who will fight for a
whore, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>. Memering jumps over the table,
<b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, and offers to be her champion. At
the first shock in the lists Memering's horse is
brought to his knees; in the second encounter
Memering takes off Ravnlil's head. Henry
offers tons of gold to redeem Gunild. Shame
befall him that sells her, says Memering, and
rides off with Gunild, leaving Henry wringing
his hands.</p>

<p><b>K</b>, like <b>A</b>, represents that Gunild was wooed
from all quarters before she was won by Henry.
Memering, who sits lowest at the board, says
to Gunild, as in <b>A</b> 20-23, that he had served
her father eleven years, and never seen her
with bare feet. In <b>C</b> Memering finds Gunild
weeping, and, learning the reason, asks the
loan of her father's horse, receives horse and
armor of proof, goes where the kemps are
drinking, and challenges the slanderer. The
burly villain says he will take him in his left
hand and chuck him out of the country, crush
all his limbs with his little finger. After the
fight, Memering presents Gunild with "the
head that has belied her," and she carries it
to Henry, who asks in wonder, Who in all
my land has hewn down a man so big? Memering,
the least of men, she says. Henry
offers him his Sudselille, his Strudselille, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-36" id="Pg_2-36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Spire, but will have Gunild for his own. Memering
bids him keep his gifts; he will not resign
Gunild, whom he has won. The diminutive
size of Memering is noted also in <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, and the hugeness of Ravnlil in <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>.
In <b>H</b> Memering knocks off his opponent's hat
in the first bout, and the head follows in the
second. Now we will ride off, says Memering
to Gunild; but Gunild will not budge till she
has had vengeance on Henry.</p>

<p>The Norwegian story has lost the beginning,
but agrees well with the Danish so far as
it goes. Gunild goes into the kemps' hall, and
asks if any man dare fight for a woman against
huge Ronnegaar. All are silent but Mimmer,
smallest of Christian men, who offers himself.
Gunild holds him cheap for his low stature,
and says he had better stay at home and keep
his sheep; but he, not rebuffed, mounts his
horse, seeks out Ronnegaar, and, after a three
days' fight, vanquishes him and cuts off his
head, which he ties to his saddle-bow and
brings back in triumph.</p>

<p>The Icelandic ballad is in accord with the
Danish until we come to the judicium dei, and
then an ordeal by hot iron takes the place of
the combat. So with the two FÃ¤rÃ¶e copies,
which, however, mix both forms, and inconsistently
bring in Memering, with nothing for
him to do. King Diderik replaces Henry
in all three, but Spire remains the place of
the action. When the returning king asks
after Gunild, he is told that the archbishop
has been seen lying with her, or the bishop's
brother, and others besides. He seizes her by
the hair and drags her from her bed, <b>F</b>, beats
her for two days, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and a third, and no
one dares interfere. At last two of his children
beg him to stop, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; ask what their
mother has done, <b>F</b>. She has been untrue.
Then let her carry iron and walk on steel.
Nine times she carries iron and ten times she
walks on steel, <b>F</b>. The conclusion is very
much injured in all these copies. In the Icelandic,
<b>F</b>, "all her iron bands fall off;" her
accuser goes to infernal punishment, and she
to heaven. In <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, after the children have
asked for the ordeal by fire, Gunild goes to the
strand, or along the street, and meets Mimmering,
smallest of Christian men, <b>E</b>, who
says he has served her father eight years, and
never saw her in such wretched plight. She
then goes to another land, <b>D</b>; Mimmering
takes her from heathen land (which at least
makes him of some use), <b>E</b>; when she enters
a church her iron bands burst. She is making
gifts of a Yule day, and gives her traducer a
red ring, meaning a rope round his neck.</p>

<p>The names of the four actors in the Scandinavian
versions are: Henry, as in English,
in all the Danish copies,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> replaced by King
Diderik in FÃ¤rÃ¶e <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, Icelandic <b>F</b>; Gunild,
or Gunder, Gunni, Gunde, in all copies, including
the Norwegian; Memering, Mimmering,
in all but the Norwegian and Danish <b>H</b>,
which have the slight modifications Mimmer,
Nimmering, these last, as also FÃ¤rÃ¶e <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
adding the suffix Tand. There is considerable
variety, always with some likeness, in the
fourth name: Raffuengaard, Danish <b>A</b>; RÃ¶ngÃ¥rd,
<b>H</b>; Ronnegaar, the Norwegian; Ravnlil,
<b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, Ravnhild, <b>I</b>; Rundkrud Hagensgaard,
<b>C</b>; Roysningur, FÃ¤rÃ¶e <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; RÃ¶gnvaldr,
Icelandic <b>F</b>. Ravengaard, RÃ¶ngÃ¥rd,
Ronnegaar, with the Anglo-Latin Rodingar,
presently to be mentioned, are evidently the
forerunners of the English Aldingar (Sir
Raldingar) and Rodingham.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The English
Eleanor is probably a later substitution
for Gunild, become unfamiliar. Eleanor may
have been meant or understood for Henry
Second's queen (less likely for Henry Third's,
though she went into a monastery), but considering
how freely the name is dealt with in
English ballads, the question is hardly worth
raising, and assuredly it never was raised
except by editors.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Memering is of diminutive size in <b>B-E</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-37" id="Pg_2-37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<b>H-K</b>, the smallest of Christian men in <b>E</b>, and
also in the Norwegian copy.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The large size
of his antagonist is noted in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, and
the Norwegian copy. His representative in
English <b>A</b> seems no more in a man's likeness
than a child of four years old. Aldingar

hundred such; and Aldingar is as big as a
fooder, "a tun of man," like Falstaff, though
not so unwieldy.</p>

<p>Gunhild, daughter of Cnut the Great and
Emma, was married in 1036 to King Henry,
afterwards the Emperor Henry III, and died
of the plague at Ravenna two years later,
never having had any trouble with her husband.
William of Malmesbury, who died only
a little more than a hundred years after Gunhild,
1142 or 1143, writes of her as follows:
She was a girl of extraordinary beauty, and
had been sighed for in vain by many suitors
before her hand was bestowed upon Henry.
She was attended to the ship which was to
take her to her husband by a procession so
splendid that it was still in William's day the
theme of popular song. After many years of
married life she was denounced for adultery,
and offered as her champion against her accuser
(who was a man of gigantic bulk),
others refusing, a mere boy that she had
brought with her from England, who by miracle
hamstrung her defamer. Gunhild then
could not be induced by threats or blandishments
to live longer with her husband, but
took the veil, and passed the remainder of a
long life in the service of God.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>It will be recognized that we have in this
narrative many points of the English and Danish
ballad: the beauty of the queen, English
<b>A</b> 2; her numerous suitors, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>K</b>; the
youth or under size of the queen's champion,
who had previously been in the service of her
family, and the huge dimensions of the other
party; the triumph of weakness and innocence,
and Gunhild's separating herself from
Henry, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G-L</b>. Nor can we well
doubt that William of Malmesbury was citing
a ballad, for the queen's wonderful deliverance
in so desperate an extremity would be even
more likely to be celebrated in popular song
than her magnificent wedding, and a ballad is
known to have been made upon a similar and
equally fabulous adventure which is alleged
in chronicle to have occurred to Gunhild's
mother.</p>

<p>Malmesbury does not mention the names
of the combatants, though he may very well
have known them. These names are supplied
by a French metrical life of Edward the Confessor,
"translatÃ©e du Latin," of which the
manuscript must have been written before
1272, and may, perhaps, be dated as early as
1245. In this poem we are told that Gunhild,
having been calumniated to her husband,
the Emperor Henry, was obliged by the custom
of the empire to purge herself by battle,
and with difficulty could find a champion, because
her accuser was of gigantic size. But
a dwarf, whom she had brought up, by name
Mimecan,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> undertook to fight for her, hamstrung
the giant at the first blow, and at the
second cut off his feet, "as the history says."
The lady, thus acquitted, declined to have the
emperor for her lord. The other name is
given in verses describing a picture of the
combat, one of many illustrations which adorn
the manuscript: How the dwarf Mimecan,
to redeem the honor of his mistress, fights
with the huge old Rodegan, and cuts off his
feet; where Rodegan is, perhaps, an adaptation
of Rodingar, for rhyme's sake;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> but we
have Rodyngham in English <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>In The Chronica Majora of Matthew Paris,
I, 515, ed. Luard, manuscript of the beginning
of the fourteenth century, the passage in
Malmesbury is repeated, with additions from
other sources. The name of Gunhild's cham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-38" id="Pg_2-38">[Pg 38]</a></span>pion
is given as Mimecan, and the dwarf is
further said to have cut off the giant's head,
as in the Norwegian version of the ballad and
Danish <b>C</b>, and to have presented it to his mistress,
as in Danish <b>C</b>. Brompton's Chronicle,
of the second half of the fourteenth century,
reiterates the story of the duel, giving the
names of both combatants, Mimecan (misprinted
or misread Municon) and Roddyngar.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>It is highly probable that this story became
connected with Gunhild, wife of Henry III,
in consequence of her bearing the name Cunigund
after her marriage, owing to which circumstance
she might become confused with
the consort of the Emperor St Henry II, St
Cunigund, in whose legendary history there is
a passage essentially similar. St Cunigund's
married life extended from 1002 to 1024.
After Henry's death she retired to a nunnery,
and she died "in the service of God,"
1033, which corresponds with what Malmesbury
says of Gunhild. Notwithstanding the
mutual asceticism of the imperial pair, reports
obtained, instigated by the devil, that
Cunigund had doubly broken her vows, nor
did these fail to make an impression on her
husband's mind. To justify herself, Cunigund
offered to walk barefoot over red-hot ploughshares,
or, according to another account, to
carry red-hot iron in her hands, and she went
through the test without injury.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> This form
of ordeal is of the nature of what is suggested
in the FÃ¤rÃ¶e and the Icelandic ballad, and
executed in the latter, where Gunild both
walks over hot steel and carries hot iron in her
hands.</p>

<p>Emma, Gunhild's mother, had the misfortune
to be subjected to the same aspersions as
her daughter and the Empress Cunigund, and
was favored with the like glorious vindication.
Accused of having a bishop for her lover, she
asked to be submitted to the ordeal of hot
iron, and walked over nine glowing ploughshares,
in the church of St Swithin, Winchester,
not only without injury, but even without
the consciousness of what she had done.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> We
are expressly informed that a ballad on the
subject was sung by a minstrel in the hall of
the prior of St Swithin on the occasion of
a visit of the Bishop of Winchester in 1338,
in conjunction with another about the giant
Colbrand.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Earlier instances of a miraculous exoneration,
under similar circumstances, are those of
Richarda, or Richardis, wife of the Emperor
Charles III, 887, and of Gundeberg, wife of
the Lombard king Arioald, c. 630.</p>

<p>Richarda, accused of adultery with a bishop,
protests, like Cunigund, not only her innocence
of crime, but her intact virginity after a
marriage of ten or twelve years, and offers
herself to the judgment of God, either by
duel or hot ploughshares; or actually proves
her integrity by some form of ordeal, divino
[aquino] judicio, or by passing through fire in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-39" id="Pg_2-39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
a waxed shift, or donning a wax shift, which
is set on fire at her hands and feet. Disculpated
thus, she goes, like Cunigund, into a
monastery for the rest of her days.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Gundeberg happening to praise a certain
nobleman's figure, he solicited her in shameless
style, and was most contemptuously rejected.
Upon this he tells the king that Gundeberg
means to poison her husband and take
another man, and the queen is put under confinement.
Remonstrance is made by the king
of the Franks, to which race Gundberg belongs,
and Arioald consents to allow her to
clear herself by a champion. One Pitto (otherwise
Carellus) fights with the accuser and
kills him.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> If Pitto, as Bugge has suggested,
and as seems more than plausible, be Little
(old Italian pitetto, etc.), then the root of the
Scandinavian-English story is found in the
early part of the seventh century. The name
Carellus may also be a significant diminutive.</p>

<p>Henry, in the Scandinavian ballad, accepts
the testimony of the man in whose charge he
had left Gunild, without asking for proof.
Circumstantial evidence is offered in the English
ballad; the false steward shows the king
a leper lying in the queen's bed. Aldingar
induces the leper to conform to his orders by
promising that he shall be a sound man in two
hours. Rodyngham gives the leper a drink,
and lays him in the bed asleep. The queen, to
the advantage of good taste, but to the detriment
of the proof, is not there in either case.</p>

<p>We have here a link with the story of
Oliva, or Sibilla, in the Charlemagne cycle of
fictions. We may begin with the second section
of the Karlamagnus saga, because we
know that it was translated from an English
copy brought home by a Norseman resident in
Scotland in 1287.</p>

<p>Olif is here sister to Charles, and married
to King Hugo. Going to the chase, Hugo
leaves his wife in the care of his steward,
Milon, who had long had a passion for her,
and takes advantage of this occasion to declare
it. The queen threatens to have him
hanged. Milon goes home, puts a potion in
a mazer, returns to the queen, and, pretending
that what he had said was only a jest and
meant to try her virtue, asks her, in token of
reconciliation, to drink the cup with him. He
feigns to begin; the queen follows in earnest,
and falls into a dead sleep. He lays her in
her bed, administers the same drink to a black
beggar, and, when it has had its effect, lays
him by the queen, putting the arms of each
about the other's neck. When the king comes
back he wonders that his wife does not come
to meet him, and asks where she is. The
steward answers, as in <b>A</b> 8, that the queen has
taken a new love, and conducts the king to
his chamber. Hugo cuts off the black man's
head. Every drop of his blood turns to a
burning candle, which makes the king think
that he has killed a holy man. But the steward
says, Not so; rather she is a witch, that
can make stones float and feathers sink, and
urges the king, now that his sword is out, to
take off the queen's head, too. The king refuses.
Olif wakes, and is astounded at what
her eyes behold. What means this black man
in her bed! God wot, says Milon, he has long
been your leman. The queen demands an
ordeal, according to the law of the land; and
successively proposes that she shall be put
naked into a copper over a hot fire, or be
thrown from a high tower on sword and spear
points, or be taken in a boat out of sight of
land and thrown into the water. The king is
each time disposed to let her have her way,
but is always dissuaded by Milon, who tells
him that no such trial would signify anything
with a witch of her powers. Hereupon a
knight leaps up and knocks Milon down for a
liar, and offers to fight him on these terms:
Milon to be fully armed and on his best horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-40" id="Pg_2-40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and the challenger to have no armor, a mule
for a steed, and a wooden wand for a weapon.
Milon is immediately thrown, but the king is
still induced to think this to be more of his
wife's magic, calls his best men to council, and
bids them determine what death she shall die.
There is no further resemblance to our ballad.
Karlamagnus Saga, Af Fru Olif ok Landres,
Unger, p. 51.</p>

<p>A FÃ¤rÃ¶e ballad, 'Ãluvu kvÃ¦Ã°i,' Hammershaimb,
in Antiquarisk Tidsskrift, 1846-48, p.
281, repeats this story with variations, and
as we are informed by Grundtvig, I, 201, so do
Icelandic rimes, 'Landres rÃ­mur,' as yet unprinted.
In the FÃ¤rÃ¶e ballad, after Ãluva's
champion (who had come with her from home,
like Memering) has unhorsed her accuser, she
passes the ordeal of water and fire triumphantly,
and still another.</p>

<p>In the Spanish prose romance of Oliva
(printed in 1498) and the French chanson
de geste of Doon l'Alemanz (fifteenth-century
manuscript), the heroine, who is now Pepin's
sister, becomes the victim of slander, not in
consequence of her having rebuffed an overweening
lover, but because the father or uncle
of the arch-traitor Ganelon had been thwarted
in his plan to match his daughter or sister
with the nobleman upon whom Pepin has bestowed
Oliva. It is an ordinary young lad
who is put into the lady's bed, and no loathsome
leper or beggar. The injured woman
asks for the ordeal of fire or of water, and, in
the Spanish romance, when these are refused
her, to be thrown from a tower. After much
difficulty this right is conceded in the latter,
and, like Richardis,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> she walks through a
blazing fire, in simple shift, without singeing
hair or thread. But all this helps her not.

<p>According to other forms of the same story,
it is Sibilla, wife of Charles the Great, that is
temporarily repudiated by her husband, owing
to a false suspicion of unfaithfulness, seemingly
justified by an ugly dwarf being found
in bed with her. A French romance, which
narrated this story, is described in the Chronicle
of Alberich, a monk of the cloister of
Trois Fontaines, in the diocese of LiÃ©ge, writing
in the first half of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
A fragment of the latter half of such
a romance, and of the same age, is preserved.
A complete tale is extant in a variety of forms:
Hystoria de la reyna SebÃ­lla, in Spanish prose,
French by origin, of which a full analysis is
given by Ferdinand Wolf, Ueber die neuesten

from the French, printed not far from the
same time, of which an ample account is also
given by Wolf in Denkschriften der kaiserlichen

nameless in the last two, and the queen bears
the name of BlanÃ§iflor in 'Macaire.' In the
two German versions the false marshal repeats
the part of the false steward in the English and
Norse story; having failed with the queen, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-41" id="Pg_2-41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
lays a sleeping dwarf in her bed. The dwarf
is principal in the Spanish and Dutch story,
and after a discomfiture in which he loses
some of his teeth at the vigorous hand of the
queen, creeps into her bed while she is asleep.
He does the same in the Venetian-French
romance, thinking to get vengeance for rough
handling from his mistress when acting as
Pandarus for Macaire, of whose spite against
the queen for rebuking his inordinate passion
he is all the while the tool.</p>

<p>Sibilla appears again as Sisibe, daughter of
a Spanish king, married to Sigmundr, father
of SigurÃ°r FÃ¡fnisbani. The king, summoned
to arms, entrusts her to two of his nobles,
one of whom, Hartvin, proposes that she shall
accept him as a husband, and is threatened
with the gallows. The two represent to the
king, on his return, that the queen has had a
handsome thrall for her partner during his
absence. Hartvin advises that she be relegated
to a desolate forest and have her tongue
cut out, to which Sigmundr assents. ÃiÃ°riks

<p>The first part of the English romance of Sir
Triamour, or a little more than 600 verses,
is derived from some French form of Sibilla.
A king going on a crusade to the holy land
commits his queen to the care of his steward;
the steward sues the queen to accept him as a
paramour, and is threatened with hanging; the
steward pretends that he has only been proving
her, but when the king comes home tells
him that he has seen a man lying with the
queen, and has slain the traitor; the king is
minded to burn his wife, but is advised by the
steward rather to banish her; three days are
allowed the queen to quit the country, and if
found after that she is to die in the fire.

<p>In like manner, Genoveva's husband is persuaded
by the false Golo, who has been
charged with the care of her and has abused
his trust, that his wife has admitted a cook
to her favor; and Octavian's mother, in the
English romance, excites her son's resentment
against his innocent queen by inducing a scullion,
"lothly of face," to get into the empress's
bed: Weber, III, 163, v. 153 ff.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Another series of tales, that has likeness in
parts with the story of Gunhild and of Sibilla,
is represented in English by the pleasing romance
of The Erl of Tolous,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> dating from
about 1400.</p>

<p>We read in this lay of Britain, as it is called
in the last stanza, that Barnard, Earl of Toulouse,
has become enamored of the Empress of
Germany, with whose lord he is at strife, and
has excited a certain interest in the mind of
the lady. The emperor selects two knights to
guard his wife; these conceive a violent passion
for her, and declare it, one after the other,
after having obtained from her a promise of
secrecy. She tells the first that he is a traitor
and deserves to be hanged, and the second
that he should be hanged had she not hight
to hold counsel. These knights, who have
been in collusion from the first, think themselves
unsafe, notwithstanding the empress's
promise, and conspire to be her ruin. They
induce a young gentleman, for a jest, to strip
himself all but bare, and hide behind a curtain
in her chamber while she is sleeping; then
summon "lords of bed" to help take a traitor
who is with their lady in her bower, find the
young man where they had put him, and bear
him through the body. The lady is cast into
prison. Her husband, who is far off, has a
dream of two wild bears tearing his wife to
pieces, and returns home with all haste. The
knights tell their story. A council is called
the next day, and it is decided that the empress
must die (be burned). An old knight
calls attention to the circumstance that the
young man's tongue is stopped, and that none
ever found a fault in the lady before; he advises
that proclamation be made for a champion,
to which the king, who loves his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-42" id="Pg_2-42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
tenderly, gladly assents. The Earl of Toulouse
hears of the lady's peril, and resolves to go to
Germany and fight for her. This, as being
on hostile terms with the emperor, he must do
in disguise. By the help of an abbot, who is
the empress's uncle, he obtains admission to
the lady in a monk's dress, hears her shrift,
and assures himself of her innocence; and
then, monk as he seems, offers to do battle
with the accusers. One is run through, the
other yields as recreant and confesses the plot,
and both are burned. The monk is revealed
by the abbot, under a pledge that he shall
receive no injury, to be Sir Barnard of Toulouse.
The emperor treats his late foe graciously,
and rewards him, even to the extent of
dying in three years, when the earl is chosen
his successor and weds the empress.</p>

with variations: (1) Miracle de la Marquise

to boast that he is the object of her passion;
in (3) a servitor is the instrument of

the lady a German empress; in (5) she is an
English queen; in (2) of British birth. In
all there is a reciprocal predilection on the
part of the lady and her champion.</p>

<p>Spanish and ProvenÃ§al chroniclers and a
Spanish ballad relate a story substantially
according with what we find in The Earl of
Toulouse, the injured heroine being an empress
of Germany, and her champion a count,
in all cases but one Count Ramon of Barcelona.</p>

<p>In the Spanish ballad 'Romance de cÃ³mo el
conde don Ramon de Barcelona librÃ³ Ã¡ la
emperatriz de AlemaÃ±a que la tenian para
quemar,' Duran, Romancero, II, 210, No 1228,
Wolf y Hofmann, Primavera, II, 102, from the
Silva de Romances of 1550, two knights, with
no motive given but their own wickedness, tell
the emperor that they have seen the empress
toying with her chamberlain. The empress is
imprisoned, and casts about for two knights to
defend her life against the accusers. In all the
chivalry of the court there is none that will
venture against appellants so redoubtable, and
she is to be burned in three days. The Count
of Barcelona hears the distressing intelligence,
and sets out to the rescue. No one being admitted
to the lady except her confessor, the
count makes known to the holy father that he
has come for the defence, and begs, if possible,
that he may first have a word with her majesty.
He has an interview, in the guise of a
monk, and is properly welcomed by the empress,
who expresses her confidence that he
will succeed in establishing her innocence, but
will not permit him even to kiss hands. Asking
only to take his adversaries one at a
time, the count speedily disposes of the first,
when the other surrenders. The emperor, delighted
with the result, wishes to show due
honor to the champion, who, however, is not
to be found, having returned to his estates
immediately after the fight; nor is the empress
at liberty to tell who he is until the third day.
He is then revealed to be the flower of chivalry,
the lord of Catalonia. The empress,
with the approval of her husband, goes to
Barcelona, attended by a magnificent train
and under conduct of two cardinals, to express
her gratitude in person, and is very
splendidly received and entertained.</p>

<p>The oldest of the chroniclers, the Catalan
Bernart Desclot, writing about 1300, ascribes
the misfortune of the empress to a harmless
partiality for a young nobleman, which was
misrepresented to the emperor by two of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-43" id="Pg_2-43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
councillors, out of envy and spite.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The empress
is allowed a year and a day to find
a champion, in default of which she is to be
burned. None of the knights to whom she has
shown kindness dare offer themselves in her
cause, on account of the high favor in which
her accusers, who engage to make good their
charge by battle, stand with their master. But
a minstrel attached to the court takes it in
hand to find her a defender, goes to Barcelona,
and so interests the count in the case that he
sets out immediately for Germany. Carbonell,
c. 1500, Beuter, c. 1530, and Pujades,
&#8224; 1635, all of whom rely in part on popular
tradition, make the count to be Ramon Berengar
III, and Beuter says that, according to
the Catalans, the empress was Matilda, daughter
of Henry I of England, who was married
to the emperor Henry V in 1114.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>ProvenÃ§al chronicles, CÃ¦sar de Nostradamus's
Histoire et chronique de Provence, 1614,
and La Royalle Couronne des Roys d'Arles,
1641, return to the baffled steward or maÃ®tre
d'hÃ´tel and his revenge. The empress is Matilda
in Nostradamus, as in Beuter, and the
steward simply accuses her of adultery, and
offers to sustain the charge by battle. No
one dares to defend the lady, because the accuser
is un fort rude et dangereux champion.
The steward is hanged after his defeat. In
La Royalle Couronne des Roys d'Arles the
emperor is said to be Henry III and the empress
Matilde, fille de Camet, qui avoit estÃ©
roy de Dannemarc et estoit roy d'Angleterre.
The emperor Henry V was as king of Arles
Henry III. Camet, whether miswritten or
not, can mean only Canut, and there is an obvious
confusion between Gunild, daughter of
Cnut, wife of Henry III of Germany, and
Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England,
wife of Henry III of Arles and V of Germany.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
This may be an historical blunder,
pure and simple, or may have been occasioned
by a knowledge of the tradition concerning
Gunild.</p>

<p>There is little or nothing in all these tales
that can be historically authenticated, and
much that is in plain contradiction with history.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Putting history out of the question,

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> This recalls Morant in Karl Meinet, Keller, 219 ff, and
in La gran conquista de ultramar, Wolf, Denkschriften der

volksbuch Hirlanda, seems to be patterned after Morant.
Hirlanda is charged with an intrigue with Olive by a graceless
nobleman, and is to be burned unless vindicated by battle.
Everybody is afraid of the impeacher's strength and skill in
fight, but he is vanquished by a mere boy (divinely assisted)
and confesses his villainy. The boy is Hirlanda's long-lost
son. This is a stale paraphrase of an old story.</p></div>

LÃ¼dtke, 78 ff. In the Arles chronicle, as also in Desclot,
Carbonell, Beuter, etc., the empress gives the count a ring
when he visits her in prison, and the same is done earlier in
The Erl of Tolous; see LÃ¼dtke, pp 80,171,181,183,191,201,
and vv 392, 1076 of the English romance. It may be noted,
without the intention of suggesting any particular inference,
that Arthur's queen in Le lai du Corn, v. 325 ff, to clear herself
from the suspicion of loving amiss, professes herself ready
to be thrown into a fire of thorns, and, should a hair of her
head or any of her dress be burned, then to be dragged at a
horse's heels. She owns that she <i>had</i> given a ring to a young
donzel, who had killed a giant that had slandered Gawain,
and then wished modestly to withdraw.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> LÃ¼dtke has endeavored, by a very carefully conducted
comparison, to show the probability of an historical foundation
for The Erl of Tolous in the relations of Bernard I, Count of
Barcelona, with the Empress Judith, second wife of Louis le
DÃ©bonnaire. By the influence of this beautiful and clever
woman, Bernard, son of the William of Orange of romance,
and later in his life Count or Duke of Toulouse, as his father
had been, was made imperial chamberlain or prime minister,
with the object of forwarding the aspirations which the empress
entertained for her son Karl. Hugo, Count of Tours,
and Matfrid, Count of Orleans, partisans of Lothair, stand for
the empress's two lovers and enemies. Judith was accused
of adultery with Bernard, and shut up in a monastery. At
an assembly of the estates of the empire in 831, she declared
herself prepared to refute the charge against her, and no accuser
appearing, did so, when required, by an oath, after
which she was restored to her rights as wife and empress.
Bernard, though already incidentally purged by the empress's
oath, some months subsequently asked the privilege
of a duel with anybody that was disposed to inculpate him,
and, no such person offering, in turn cleared himself by an
oath. See LÃ¼dtke, p. 98 ff, p. 209 ff. Hildegard, Louis's
mother, according to tradition, labored under the same imputation
as Judith, his wife; a parallel to the case of Gunild
and her mother Emma. The story of Hildegard (Grimms,
Deutsche Sagen, II, 102) has some resemblance to that of
Repsima, Les Mille et un Jours, p. 265, Paris, 1840, and
Jonathan Scott's Arabian Nights, VI, 396, 'Adventures of
the Cauzce,' etc.</p></div>

<h2><a name="Ballad_60" id="Ballad_60">60</a><br />
KING ESTMERE</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>a.</b> Percy's Reliques, edition of 1794, I, 64.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> Reliques, edition of 1765, I, 58.</p></div>


<p>'King Estmere' occurred at page 249 of
Percy's folio manuscript, but the three leaves
on which it was written were "unfortunately
torn out" by Percy to send to the press, and
the genuine form of the ballad thereby put
beyond recovery. In the second and later
editions of the Reliques the editor professes
to give the ballad from two copies ("containing
very great variations," 1794), one of them
being that of the folio. But here and elsewhere
Percy employs a singular periphrasis,
as he has explained to us in the preface to
the Reliques, and means only that he has
amended his original more or less. Notwithstanding
the seemingly explicit language, there
is no second copy at all.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>We are told by Percy, in a note to stanza
63, that though liberties have been taken with
that portion of the ballad which follows, yet
wherever the fourth edition differs from the
preceding ones it has been brought nearer to
the folio.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Some notes of readings of the
folio are also furnished in the fourth edition
(and are here restored), which were not given
in the others. While we cannot but be vexed
that so distinguished a ballad, not injured
much, so far as we can see, by time, should
not come down to us as it came to Percy, our
loss must not be exaggerated. The changes
made by the editor, numerous enough, no
doubt, cannot be very material until we approach
the end. Stanzas 63-66 are entirely
suspicious, and it may even be questioned
whether the manuscript contained a word that
is in them.</p>

<p>The name of Bremor, son of the king of
Spain, and "a heathen hound" (if this be not
Percy's interpolation), taken with certain resemblances
in the story, very naturally suggested
to Professor Sophus Bugge (Grundtvig,
IV, 704) a connection between this ballad
and 'Young Orm and Bermer-Giant,' 'Orm
Ungersvend og Bermer-Rise.'<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The giant,
who is described as a rabid berserker, presents
himself at the Danish court (Grundtvig, <b>A</b>),
and demands that the king shall give him his
daughter and half his land, or find a man who
will fight in the ring with him. The king refuses
daughter and land, and says he will find
a champion. He offers the chance of winning
so fair a may to his men, and no one dares
say a word except Young Orm, who sits low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-50" id="Pg_2-50">[Pg 50]</a></span>est
at the board: he will be the man. But
first Orm provides himself with an irresistible
sword, which is buried in his father's tomb,
and is yielded by the dead man only upon the
condition that his son shall take the revenge
due for his death. With this sword Orm, like
the child in '<a href="#Ballad_59">Sir Aldingar</a>,' cuts the giant
through at the knees, being, he says, not tall
enough to strike higher. He then goes to Iceland,
and fights three days with the men who
had slain his father, but without prevailing.
A mermaid, from the sea-bottom, cries out to
him that his sword is under a spell, and that
he must whirl it three times round his head
and then stick the point in the ground. This
done, he has no difficulty in despatching his
foes. He returns to the Danish court, and
marries the princess.</p>

<p>The likeness between the English ballad
and the Danish (which represents well enough
the other Norse poems) is that a youthful
champion wins a king's daughter by killing a
truculent competitor, who has nearly the same
name in both (Bremor, Bermer).</p>

<p>Further consideration led Bugge to maintain
that the proper subject of 'King Estmere'
is rather the story of Hjalmar, Odd and
Anganty, and that the English ballad is better
represented by the tragic FÃ¤rÃ¶e ballad of
'Arngrim's Sons' than by 'Orm and Bermer-Giant,'
which last he regards as a free
reconstruction of an earlier and fuller form of
'Arngrim's Sons' than has come down to us.
The points in which the story of Hjalmar, Odd
and Anganty<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> is like 'King Estmere,' in contrast
with the Orm ballad, are that the hero
does not fight single-handed with the giant,
but has the help of Odd (Adler); that the
king's daughter chooses her husband for herself;
that the bride is not won by a sword
taken from a father's grave. The argument
is, however, much too intricate and too long
to be repeated here, even had the subtle and
accomplished advocate shown full confidence
in the conclusion.</p>

<p>But this confidence he does not feel, for, as
he conceives, King Estmere again exhibits resemblances
to 'Ogier le Danois,' the basis of
the Danish ballad 'Holger Danske og Burmand,'
Grundtvig, No 30.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The name Adler,
says Bugge, is about as near to Ogier, Oddgeir,
as to Oddr. Adler's brother, Estmere, might
be the chivalrous paynim Karaheus, despite
the unlike name, and King Adland's daughter
the amiral's daughter Gloriande, the beloved
of Karaheus. Brunamons of Majorca, to
whom the amiral offers his daughter after the
defection of Karaheus, may be Bremer of
Spain. Ogier, like Adler (in Percy's edition),
kills the hateful interloper, and Karaheus,
like Estmere, gets the lady, but without taking
part in the fight. If this hypothesis is
not quite so satisfactory as the other, we may
combine both. The English ballad may have
been derived from some form of 'Arngrim's
Sons,' but have been modified under the influence
of 'Ogier le Danois.'<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>A brief statement of these speculations may
suffice in view of their inconclusiveness, which
is the greater by reason of our not knowing
to what extent Percy interfered with his manuscript.</p>

<p>The names Adler and Estmere appear again
in a short romance in the Percy manuscript,
Hales and Furnivall, II, 296. The story is
that of Hugdietrich in the Heldenbuch: von
der Hagen, I, 169, ed. 1855, Amelung and
JÃ¤nicke, I, 167; given by Weber in Illustrations
of Northern Antiquities, p. 63. Adler
is a king, and, like Estmere in the ballad, is
exacting in the matter of a wife. In the Heldenbuch
it is not the young man who is so difficult
to suit, but his guardian. Estmere (v.
11, where there is corruption or defect) appears
to be Adler's messenger to King Ardine,
the father of a lady who answers all require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-51" id="Pg_2-51">[Pg 51]</a></span>ments,
and who, as it turns out, likes Adler,
but is not to be had on easy terms.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>'King Estmere' begins very much like the
Danish ballad, 'Den farlige Jomfru,' Grundtvig,
No 184, and especially like version <b>D</b>.</p>

<p>The champion of England formerly rode
into Westminster Hall in the coronation ceremony,
but this part of the spectacle was
omitted from the two last coronations.</p>

<p>King Estmere stables his steed at the hall
board. Here again the minstrel is within the
bounds of custom. "On voyait au moyen
Ã¢ge, dans la salle des chefs gallois, d'Ã©normes
crampons de fer, fixÃ©s au pavÃ© de distance en
distance, qui servaient aux chevaliers pour attacher
leurs chevaux, car ils y entraient souvent
avec eux; quelques-uns les conduisaient

The statement that 'King Estmere' was "unfortunately
torn out in sending the... piece to the press" is far from
intelligible. Since readings were given from the manuscript
in the fourth edition for the first time, one would suppose
that the original was still in the editor's hands when that
edition was prepared. But the three leaves from the manuscript
would have been much less convenient to send to the
press than the copy already three times printed in the Reliques;
and Percy himself pleads in excuse for his taking out
leaves from the manuscript, to save the trouble of transcribing,
that he was very young, and "had not then learnt to
reverence it." The readings from the manuscript, which
first appear in the fourth edition, may possibly be from
notes; one would hope that Percy would not trust his memory
after the lapse of thirty years. Hales and Furnivall, I,

of the fourth edition are printed in parallel columns.</p></div>

SIR CAWLINE</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Percy MS., p. 368; Hales and Furnivall, III, 3.</p></div>


<p>The copy of this ballad in the Percy manuscript,
the only one known to exist, shows
very great carelessness on the part of the
transcriber, or of some predecessor. It begins
with these two stanzas, which manifestly belong
to an historical ballad, and have only a
verbal connection with what follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jesus, lord mickle of might,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Th</i>at dyed ffor us on the roode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To maintaine vs in all our right<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Th</i>at loues true English blood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ffor by a k<i>nigh</i>t I say my song,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was bold and ffull hardye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">S<i>i</i>r Robert Briuse wold fforth to ffight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In-to Ireland ouer the sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a large omission after the 125th
verse (the 28th stanza as here printed), though
the writing is continuous. There are also
several difficult or unintelligible passages, even
more than are usually met with in this manuscript.</p>

<p>As published in the Reliques of Ancient
English Poetry, I, 35, ed. 1765, I, 41, ed. 1794,
'Sir Cawline' is extended to nearly twice
the amount of what is found in the manuscript,
and a tragical turn is forced upon the
story.</p>

<p>I have said that the copy of 'Sir Cawline'
in the Percy manuscript is the only one
known. There are nevertheless two Scottish
ballads, one hitherto unpublished and one
printed by Buchan, which narrate Sir Colvin's
winning the king's daughter by vanquishing
the elritch knight. These, I conceive, however,
to be simple rifacimenti of the ballad in
Percy's Reliques. They will be given in an
appendix.</p>

<p>'Sir Cawline' may possibly be formed upon a
romance in stanzas<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> which itself was composed
from earlier ballads. There are two adventures
in the ballad, one with an elritch knight,
and a second with a five-headed giant who is
at the same time a hend soldan, and there
seem to be traces of another in the now unintelligible
twenty-ninth stanza. The first adventure,
though not of the same commonplace
description as the second, is still by no means
unique. We are immediately reminded of the
beautiful romance of Eger, Grime and Gray-Steel:
how Gray-Steel kept a forbidden country
beyond seven days of wilderness, and how
Grime slew the up to that time unmatched
Gray-Steel with the sword Erkyin [Egeking],
brought from beyond the GreekÃ«s sea, and cut
off his hand, with fingers thrice a common
man's size, and on every finger a gay gold
ring.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Gray-Steel, to be sure, is pictured
rather as a giant than an elf, but still gives the
impression of something out of the ordinary,
as having perhaps lost an elritch character in
the course of tradition. The elritch knight in
our ballad haunts the moors, far from any good
town, like Grendel, who held the moors and
fens, but there is only a hint of that supernatural
terror which attends the awful "march-stepper"
in BeÃ³wulf. Gervase of Tilbury
has a story of an ancient entrenchment in the
bishopric of Ely, where anybody could have a
passage at arms with an unearthly warrior, by
moonlight only, by simply calling out, "Come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-57" id="Pg_2-57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
knight, and meet knight."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Scott has introduced
a spectral combat of this sort into his
Marmion, Canto <span class="smcap">III</span>, xxiii-xxv, and in a note
(4) cites a similar encounter from Heywood's
Hierarchy of Blessed Angels. He adds that a
forest in the North Highlands is believed to
be haunted by a martial spirit called Lham-dearg,
or Bloody Hand, who insists on all
whom he meets doing battle with him. VillemarquÃ©
has a tale like that of Gervasius, Les
Romans de la Table Ronde, etc., 1860, p. 392 f
(Liebrecht). These combatants and combats
are rather shadowy compared with Grendel,
Gray-Steel, our Elritch King, and an encounter
with them.</p>

<p>'Liden Grimmer og Hjelmer Kamp,' a ballad
of the 'Orm Ungersvend' class, Grundtvig,
No 26 (I, 352, from manuscripts of the
16th and the 17th century, IV, 762, from recent
tradition), has the same remote and general
resemblance to 'Sir Cawline' that 'Orm
Ungersvend' has to '<a href="#Ballad_60">King Estmere</a>,' the points
of agreement permitting the supposition of a
far-off connection, or of no connection at all.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
In Danish <b>A</b>, Grimmer, a young man who
never went to a dance except with a drawn
sword in his hand or sat down to table out of
his corselet, sails to the heathen-king's land
and asks him for his daughter. The king
tells him that he will not get the fair maid
unless he fights with Hjelmer Kamp and wins.
The king's daughter, who is as favorably inclined
to Grimmer as King Adland's daughter
is to Estmere (and King Ardine's daughter to
Adler), though in neither case has there been
a previous meeting, tells him that no man ever
came back from a fight with Hjelmer, and
that Grimmer is far from understanding her
father, who really wishes his death. Grimmer
is not at all daunted, and so the lady
gives him a sword with which he is sure to
prevail. Thus equipped he makes sail for
Hjelmer Kamp, who receives him with contemptuous
remarks upon his size, but is presently
cut to bits. Stopping only long enough
to make boot of Hjelmer's gold, Grimmer
returns to the heathen-king's court, and receives
the princess in marriage. The resemblance
of the Danish ballad is to be found
in Cawline's second adventure, that with the
giant, where the elritch sword represents the
invincible weapon bestowed by the princess.
In Danish <b>B</b> a coat of mail goes with the
sword, "som icke skal suerd paa bide." This
coat is like Estmere's after Adler has brought
his magic to bear, and Cawline's fight with the
giant, Estmere's with Bremor, and Hjelmer's
with the kemp have all an obvious similitude.</p>

<p>Two verbal peculiarities in this ballad will
not fail to be remarked: a superfluous <i>and</i>,
7<sup>4</sup>, without and a good leedginge, 8<sup>3</sup>, and take
you doe and the baken bread, 27<sup>1</sup>, and hee
tooke then vp and that eldryge sword, 39<sup>1</sup>,
but take you doo and your lands broad, and
again 26<sup>1</sup>(?); <i>for</i> used, apparently, in the
sense of <i>but</i> (as in "for and a shrouding
sheet"), 11<sup>3</sup>, ffor if you wold comfort me
with a kisse, 13<sup>3</sup>, ffor some deeds of armes
ffaine wold I doe, 22<sup>5</sup>, ffor they tooke and two
good swords; in this last we have the superfluous
<i>and</i> again. These were, perhaps, only
tricks of some ballad-singer, eking out his
measure with half-articulated syllables.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<h3>APPENDIX</h3>

<p>The first of the following pieces is described as
having been learned by Mrs Harris, in Perthshire,
about 1790, transmitted by recitation to her daughter,
and written down from recollection in 1859.
No account is given of the derivation of the other.
Both make the princess marry Sir Colvin after his
victory on the elritch hill, rejecting Percy's pathetic
conclusion. Neither retains much of the phraseology
of Percy's manuscript, and neither shows
those traces of Percy's phraseology which would
demonstrate its parentage. The first, though the
style is stale enough, has not the decidedly stall-copy
stamp of the other. It undoubtedly has passed
through a succession of mouths (as is shown by the
change of leech to match in 3<sup>2</sup>), but we may doubt
whether the other was ever sung or said. 8<sup>4</sup>, in the
Harris version,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sin the first nicht that I was born,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is close to the Percy manuscript, 17<sup>4</sup>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Since the day that I was borne,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>where Percy's Reliques has,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-61" id="Pg_2-61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he did him scath and scorne.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the old manuscript, when Sir Cawline cuts off the
elritch knight's hand, the hand flies over the knight's
head and falls down on that lay land; in Buchan,
25, 26, the hand also flies into the sky and lights on
the ground; but Percy says merely that the knight
fell on that lay land. So that there is one case in
each of agreement with the Percy manuscript where
the Reliques depart from it. It may also he urged
that Buchan, 22<sup>1, 2</sup>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To trouble any Christian one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lives in the righteous law,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is nearer to what we find in the manuscript, st. 25,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And to meete noe man of middle-earth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that liues (='lieves) on Christs his lay,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>than Percy's,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That thou wilt believe on Christ his laye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thereto plight thy hand;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And that thou never on Eldridge come.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Were there anything characteristic or otherwise
remarkable in the passages where there is agreement
with the Percy manuscript and divergence from the
Reliques, even one case of such agreement could
not be lightly set aside.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> But such agreements
as these are not significant enough to offset the
general character of the Scottish ballads, which is
not that of a traditional waif, but of a fabrication
of recent times. It is most likely that the Harris
ballad was put together by some one who was imperfectly
acquainted with the copy in the Reliques.
Whether Buchan's ballad was formed upon some
copy of the Harris version it is not worth the while
to ask.</p>

<p>The fragment <b>D</b>, printed in 1769, antedates
the committing to writing of any of the other
versions. <b>E</b> was taken down as early as 1783.
<b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are from the beginning of this century.
<b>A</b> was obtained "chiefly from the recitation
of an old woman," but we are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-64" id="Pg_2-64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
informed who supplied the rest. Herd's fragment,
<b>D</b>, furnished stanzas 2-6, 12, 17, 19. A
doubt may be hazarded whether stanzas 8-10
came from the old woman. <b>I</b> is a combination
of three recited versions, and <b>J</b>, perhaps a transcript
of a stall-copy, is, like many of Buchan's
ballads, extended to twice the length of genuine
versions by tedious, sometimes nauseous,
amplification and interpolation.</p>

<p>'Lady Jane,' Jamieson's Popular Ballads,
II, 73, is a combination of <b>B</b> and <b>E</b>, with a
good many bad verses of Jamieson's own. A
version in Motherwell's MS., p. 477, "from
the recitation of an old maid-servant of Mr
Alexander, of Southbar," was, as would be inferred
from a memorandum at the end of the
transcript, derived from a printed book, and is
in fact an imperfect recollection of this compounded
ballad of Jamieson's.</p>

<p>Grundtvig has attempted a reconstitution
of the ballad from versions <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, V, 42.</p>

<p>Annie [Helen, <b>B</b>, Ellen, <b>G</b>, Jane, <b>E</b>] was
stolen from home in her childhood, <b>A</b> 15,
<b>B</b> 23, <b>C</b> 31, <b>E</b> 9, <b>F</b> 25, <b>I</b> 38, <b>J</b> 50, 51, by a
knight from over sea, to whom she has borne
seven sons, out of wedlock. Her consort bids
her prepare to welcome a bride, with whom
he shall get gowd and gear; with her he got
none. But she must look like a maid, comb
down her yellow locks, braid her hair.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Annie
meekly assents, for love, she says, in <b>C</b> 12;
in <b>I</b> 4, <b>J</b> 15, the welcoming goes against her
heart; in <b>F</b> 9 she is told that she is to do it;
in <b>H</b> 2 she says the welcome will have to come
from him. Annie receives the bride and her
train and serves the tables, suppressing her
tears and drinking water to keep her cheek
from paling. She passes for servant or housekeeper,
and in <b>I</b> 23, <b>J</b> 25, uses the word 'master,'
not to anger the bride; in <b>C</b> 17 she calls
her lord brother, and the knight calls her sister
in <b>C</b> 18 and (inconsistently) in <b>J</b> 38.
What 'n a lady's that? asks the bride, <b>E</b> 9,
<b>J</b> 37, and what means all these bonny boys
that follow at her heel? <b>J</b> 37.</p>

<p>When the married pair have gone to their
bed-chamber, Annie, in a room near by, bewails
her sad lot in song; to the harp or her
virginals, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>I</b>. The bride hears the
lament: it is that of a woman who will go
mad ere day, <b>B</b> 20, <b>C</b> 26, <b>J</b> 44, 48. The
bride goes to Fair Annie's chamber, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>?
to see what gars her greet, inquires her parentage,
and discovers that they are sisters; or
learns this fact from the song itself, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>;
or recognizes her sister's voice, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>. King
Henry was their father, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>; King Easter,
<b>C</b>;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the Earl of Wemyss, of Richmond, <b>A</b>,
<b>E</b>. Queen Easter was their mother, <b>F</b>; Queen
Catherine, Elinor [Orvis], <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>. The bride,
who had come with many well-loaded ships,
gives all or most of them to her sister, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, and goes virgin home, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>;
expecting, as <b>B</b>, <b>J</b> add, to encounter derision
for going away wife and coming back maid.</p>

<p>In <b>C</b> 27 the bride suspects that the woman
who wails so madly is a leman, and urges her
husband to get up and pack her down the
stairs, though the woods were ne'er so wild.
He refuses. A similar scene is elsewhere put
earlier, during the bridal entertainment, <b>I</b> 29,
30, <b>J</b> 40: see also <b>G</b> 2, 3, which are partly explained
by these passages, and partly by <b>J</b> 36.</p>

<p>There are other variations in the story, and
some additional particulars in one or another
version: none of these, however, seem to belong
to the original ballad. The bride, as
soon as she sees Annie, is struck with the resemblance
to her lost sister, <b>A</b> 14, <b>E</b> 9, <b>J</b> 29.
The bridegroom repents, and rejects the woman
he has married, <b>E</b> 19, <b>F</b> 30, <b>J</b> 49. The
bridegroom confiscates without ceremony, as
tocher for Annie, six of the seven ships which
the bride had brought with her, <b>E</b>, <b>J</b>.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Danish ballad of Fair Annie has been
known to the English for fourscore years
through Jamieson's translation. The Scandinavian
versions are the following.</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b>'SkjÃ¶n Anna,' Grundtvig, No 258,
V, 13, eight versions: <b>A</b>, 39 four-line stanzas,
<b>B</b>, 34 sts, <b>C</b>, 45 sts, from manuscripts of the sixteenth
century; <b>D</b>, 48 sts, <b>E</b>, 41 sts, <b>G</b>, 32 sts,
from seventeenth-century manuscripts; <b>F</b>, 41
sts, from broadsides or stall-copies, the earliest
dated 1648, from Peder Syv, 1695, and from
copies lately taken down which were derived
from printed texts; <b>H</b>, 43 sts, a version recently
obtained from tradition in Norway.
Of these, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b> are independent texts;
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> are derived from some copy of <b>C</b>, or
from a version closely akin to <b>C</b>; <b>H</b> is essentially
the broadside copy <b>F</b>, but has one stanza
of its own. <b>F</b>, Syv, No 17, Danske Viser, IV,
59, No 177, the form through which the Danish
ballad has been made known by English
translations, is unfortunately an impure and
sophisticated text.</p>

<p><b>Swedish.</b> <b>A</b>, 'SkÃ¶n Anna,' 19 sts, Arwidsson,
I, 291, No 42; <b>B</b>, Afzelius, I, 24,
No 5, 32 sts; <b>C</b>, WigstrÃ¶m, Folkdiktning, I, 57,
No 28, 37 sts. <b>C</b> follows in the main Danish
<b>F</b>, but with a variation in st. 31 which is of
much importance if traditional. A translation
of Danish <b>F</b> has long circulated in Sweden
as a broadside: see, besides Grundtvig,
BergstrÃ¶m's Afzelius, II, 30.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian story will, for more brevity,
be collected principally from Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and some variations of the other copies
be added.</p>

<p>Fair Annie [Anneck, Annecke, <b>A</b>], a king's
daughter, is stolen in her early years, and sold
to a man of rank, who is in fact heir to a
crown. They have seven sons in eight [seven]
years, and he then becomes king. Fair Annie
begs the queen-mother to intercede with her
son now to make her a lawful wife and legitimate
his children. The mother loves Annie,
and heartily desires that he may. The son
refuses; she has great virtues, but he does not
know Annie's friends [her forbears, lineage,
Danish <b>F</b>, Swedish <b>C</b>]. He makes suit for
a king's daughter in a distant land. Annie's
heart all but breaks when the bride comes.
The young king asks the bride what gift she
will give his <i>amie</i>, <b>A</b>. I will give her my
old shoes, she says, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>. She must give
something else if she would get his good will.
Then she will give Annie seven mills that
lie far over the Rhine and grind nought but
cinnamon, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>. Annie is now asked
what gift she will make the bride. I will give
her <i>you</i>, whom I can so ill spare, answers
Annie. No, that is not enough; she must
give another gift to win the bride's good will.
I will give her the seven sons I have borne,
says Annie. Neither is that enough; she
must give the bride her gold brooch. This
Annie will not surrender, for it was his morning-gift.
Annie now asks her lord to let her
go into the bride-house [hall] and see the bride.
He refuses emphatically, but his kind mother
says, Yes; she will even go with Annie, though
it should cost her her life. Annie goes to
the bride-house, preceded by her seven sons,
who wear her father's color. She pours wine
for the bride, with many tears, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>. The
bride asks who this fair woman is that weeps so
sore. And who are these that wear her father's
color?<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> It is the king's sister's daughter,
from a foreign land, <b>C-F</b>, <b>H</b>; his sister, Danish
<b>A</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. "It is not your sister's
daughter," says the bride; "that I plainly
see. I fear it is your leman," <b>C</b> 34, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. The
king now avows the truth. It is Fair Annie,
my leman, Danish <b>A</b> 33, Swedish <b>A</b> 16 (which
adds, "Her father I never knew"); she was
stolen from a foreign land in her young days,
and has been with me seven years, Danish <b>B</b>
31; she was sold to me from a foreign land;
these are her seven sons, they will be bastards
now, and that is the cause of her grief, <b>C</b> 35,
36, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; these are my seven sons, Fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-66" id="Pg_2-66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Annie is their mother, Swedish <b>B</b> 27. I had a
sister, says the bride; she was stolen from my
father's land; Fair Annie was her name, this
must be she,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> she shall keep her husband.
The king sends the new-come bride home with
due ceremony, and keeps Fair Annie for his
heart's delight, <b>C</b> 37-44, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>.</p>

<p>In Danish <b>G</b> 7, the king gives as a reason
for not espousing Fair Annie that she has no
fortune, ingen rente, which is the objection
to her in English <b>A</b> 1, <b>C</b> 2, etc. The oldest
[youngest] son of Fair Annie attends his
mother's sister to her father's land in Swedish
<b>C</b>, Danish <b>F</b>, <b>K</b>, as in English <b>J</b> 54. The king
promises his brother to Annie's sister in Danish
<b>A</b> 39 (compare also Swedish <b>B</b> 33). In
English <b>I</b> 26, <b>J</b> 30, the bride thinks <i>her</i>
brother would be a good match for Annie.</p>

<p>Swedish <b>C</b>, though in itself of little authority,
has an advantage over the Danish copies
and Swedish <b>B</b> in making Annie refuse to part
with the gold brooch, not because it was a
morning-gift, but because she had had it ever
since she was a child and was kidnapped from
her father's court; and again in making this
brooch the means of her recognition as sister
by the bride.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian ballad is regarded by
Grundtvig as transmitted from Low German.
The rhymes are frequently not after the Danish
manner (see Grundtvig, V, 46, 7), and the
heroine's name has a Low German look.</p>

<p>Dutch and German versions, all ill enough
preserved, are:</p>

<p><b>Dutch.</b> <b>A.</b> 'SchÃ¶n Adelheid,' 22 four-line
stanzas, Hoffmann, NiederlÃ¤ndische Volkslieder,
2d ed., 1856, p. 46, No 11, 'Mooi Aeltje
en Koning Alewijn,' Willems, p. 177, No 70;
from Den Italiaenschen Quacksalver, Amsterdam,
1708. <b>B.</b> 'Madel,' 15 stanzas, Snellaert,
Oude en nieuwe Liedjes, p. 70, No 65, 2d ed.,
1864.</p>

<p><b>German.</b> <b>A.</b> Longard, AltrheinlÃ¤ndische
MÃ¤hrlein und Liedlein, 1843, p. 23, No 12;
Wilhelm von Zuccalmaglio, Deutsche Volkslieder,
1840, p. 74, No 32,=Mittler, No 333:
21 four-line stanzas. <b>B.</b> Montanus (Vincenz
von Zuccalmaglio), Die deutschen Volksfeste,
1854, p. 46, 17 stanzas, apparently rewritten.</p>

<p>According to Dutch <b>A</b> Aaltje, Ethel, Adeline,
a king's daughter, is stolen, and sold for
a great sum to King Alewijn. She asks the
king's mother, who is quite disposed to have
her for a daughter, when her son will marry
her, and the mother asks her son how long
Maid Aaltje is to live under disgrace. The
king objects that Aaltje is a <i>vondeling</i>, a waif-woman
(English <b>C</b> 2, <b>I</b> 2); Heaven only
knows her friends and kin. He adds that he
was over the Rhine yesterday, and that Aaltje
will break her heart with sorrow. The young
woman asks the mother's permission to go to
the bride's house, and is told to go in good
style, her seven sons before her and fourteen
ladies-in-waiting behind. The king meets
Aaltje half-way, and says, If you are going to
the bride's house, what gift do you mean to
make the bride? The bride will have enough,
she replies; I will give her my old stockings
and shoes. She must give something better
to gain her friendship. Then Aaltje will give
her "seven sons of yours and mine" to serve
her. She will have your seven sons, says the
king, but you must give her your brooch.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
No, that you will not get, says Aaltje. There
were two at my father's court; my sister and I
each had one. Are you then of royal birth?
says the king. Had you told me that, I would
have married <i>you</i>. When Aaltje appears at
the bride's house, they offer her to drink,
and many a tear she drops in the cup. Who
is this woman that weeps so piteously? asks
the bride. These are some of our nieces and
nephews, who have come from foreign parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-67" id="Pg_2-67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to bring you presents, is the king's answer.
Nieces and nephews! says the bride; it is
Maid Aaltje, my youngest sister. She takes
the crown from her head: Take it, Aaltje,
and keep your husband. Saddle my horse. I
came in honor, I must go back in shame.
(Cf. English <b>B</b> 26, <b>I</b> 45.)</p>

<p><b>B.</b> Madel (M'Adel), the oldest of a king's
two daughters, is stolen by a king's son to be
his leman, and taken to a far country. They
have seven sons, and he forsakes her and betroths
himself to her sister. He asks his
mother what present she will make his bride;
she has seven mills which she will give her.
Madel, asked in like manner, replies, My old
stockings and shoes. Madel asks the queen-mother
if she may go to the bridal, for the
king is to marry, and is answered as in <b>A</b>.
When she comes to the bride-loft they pour
wine for her, and she drops tears in the cup.
The bride asks who this is, and the king replies,
One of my nieces from a far country,
who came to do me honor, but only puts me
to shame. You are not telling me the truth,
says the bride. The king owns that it is
Madel, his leman, with her seven sons. The
bride recognizes a brooch<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> stiff with gold and
silk. "There are but two such in all Flanders;
I and my sister each had one." She
tears the crown from her own head and puts
it on her sister, saying, King, marry her in
my place. The brooch is distinctly made the
means of identification, which it by all likelihood
was originally in all the Scandinavian
ballads, though only Swedish <b>C</b> has retained
(or restored) this feature.</p>

<p>The <b>German</b> ballad resembles Dutch <b>A</b>
closely. The queen-mother gives Adelheid
permission to go to the wedding, and her
seven sons must walk before her. At the
feast the king offers her to drink; she cannot
drink for the grief he has caused her. The
bride sees her weeping, and orders food and
drink to be offered her (cf. English <b>J</b> 36), but
she cannot touch them. The king pretends
that she is one of his nieces who has lived with
him seven years [is fatigued by her journey,
<b>B</b>]. The bride exclaims, I see the fore-span
(by your fore-span, <b>A</b>), you are driving a pair!
In <b>A</b> she asks the fair woman's name and
country. Her country is over the Rhine, and
thence she had been stolen. "Then you must
be my sister," declares the bride somewhat
hastily, gives up her seat and the crown, puts
her ring on Adelheid's finger, and bids the
news be sent to father and mother.</p>

<p>The lyric beauty of the Scottish version of
this ballad, especially conspicuous in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>,
has been appreciatingly remarked by Grundtvig.</p>

<p>But Fair Annie's fortunes have not only
been charmingly sung, as here; they have
also been exquisitely <i>told</i> in a favorite lay of
Marie de France, 'Le Lai del Freisne.' This
tale, of Breton origin, is three hundred years
older than any manuscript of the ballad. Comparison
will, however, quickly show that it is
not the source either of the English or of the
Low German and Scandinavian ballad. The
tale and the ballads have a common source,
which lies further back, and too far for us to
find.</p>

<p>The story of the lay is this.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> There were
two knights in Brittany, living on contiguous
estates, and both married. The lady of one of
the two gave birth to two boys, and the father
sent information of the event to his neighbor
and friend. His friend's wife was a scoffing,
envious woman, "judging always for the
worse," and said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I marvel much, thou messenger,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-68" id="Pg_2-68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of the same year the woman
that had made this hateful insinuation was
brought to bed of twin girls. To save her reputation
she was ready even to put one of them
to death, but a favorite damsel in her house
suggested a better way out of her perplexity,
and that was to leave one of the children at
the door of a convent. The child, wrapped
in a rich pall that had been brought from
Constantinople, with a jewelled ring bound
to its arm to show that it was well born, was
taken away in the night to a considerable distance,
and was laid between the branches of
a great ash-tree in front of a nunnery. In the
morning it was discovered by the porter, who
told his adventure to the abbess; and the abbess,
having inspected the foundling, resolved
to bring it up under the style of her niece.
The girl, who received the name La Freisne
from the tree in which she had been found,
turned out a marvel of beauty and of all good
qualities. A gentleman of the vicinity fell in
love with her, and made large gifts to the
monastery to constitute himself a lay-brother,
and so have access to her without exciting
suspicion. He obtained her love, and in the
end induced her to fly with him to his chÃ¢teau.
This she did with sufficient deliberation to
take with her the robe and ring which were
the tokens of her birth; for the abbess had told
her how she had been found in the ash, and
had committed these objects to her care. She
lived a good while with the knight as his mistress,
and made herself loved by everybody;
but his retainers had repeatedly remonstrated
with him for not providing himself with a
lawful successor, and at last forced him to
marry the daughter and heiress of a gentleman
near by. On the day of the nuptials La
Freisne let no sign of grief or anger escape
her, but devoted herself to the bride so amiably
as even to win over the mother, who
had accompanied her daughter, and had at
first felt much uneasiness at the presence of a
possible rival. Finding the marriage bed not
decked with sufficient elegance, La Freisne
took from a trunk the precious pall from Constantinople,
and threw it on for a coverlet.
When the bride's mother was about to put her
daughter to bed, this robe was of course the
first object that met her eyes. Her heart
quaked. She sent for the chamberlain, and
asked where the cloth came from. The chamberlain
explained that "the damsel" had put
it on to improve the appearance of the bed.
The damsel was summoned, and told what she
knew: the abbess who brought her up had
given her the robe, and with it a ring, and
charged her to take good care of them. A
sight of the ring was asked; the lady cried,
You are my daughter, and fainted. When she
recovered she sent for her husband and confessed
everything. The husband was only too
happy to find that the damsel tant pruz Ã¨
sage Ã¨ bele was his daughter. The story was
repeated to La Freisne, and then to the knight
and to the archbishop who had performed the
marriage ceremony. The marriage was dissolved
the next day, and La Freisne formally
espoused by the knight, who received with
her half her father's heritage. The sister
went home and made a rich marriage.</p>

<p>The common ground-work of the ballads
and the lay is, that a man who has formed
an irregular union with a woman whose family
he does not know undertakes matrimony
with another person, who is discovered on the
day of the nuptials to be sister to his leman.
A jewel in the possession of the latter, by itself
or together with another token, reveals
and proves the kinship in the lay and in the
Scandinavian-German ballad, but there is no
trace of such an instrumentality in the Scottish.</p>

<p>Single features, or even several features, of
the story of Fair Annie or of La Freisne occur
in many other ballads and tales, but there is
no occasion to go into these resemblances here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-69" id="Pg_2-69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
A Norse ballad has almost every point in
'Fair Annie' but the sisterly relation of leman
and bride: see 'Slegfred og Brud,' Grundtvig,
No 255, and 'Thomas o Yonderdale,' an
apocryphal ballad of Buchan's, further on.
Bare mention may be made of the beautiful
Spanish romance 'Las dos Hermanas,' found
also in Portuguese, in which the queen of a
Moor or Turk discovers her sister in a slave
who has been presented to her, or captured at
her request.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

aware of his bride's being the sister of his mistress, and that he
had courted her, not with a view of retaining her as his wife,
but of securing from her father a portion for Lady Jane, whom
he intended to marry:" a canny project adopted into the degenerate

<p><b>A</b> was printed in Percy's Reliques, III,
58, ed. 1765, with comparatively few changes.
<b>B a</b> was published by Jamieson, from Mrs
Brown's manuscript, in his Popular Ballads, I,
113, with some slight variation from the text,
many acknowledged interpolations, and the
addition of three sentimental stanzas to make
Burd Ellen die just as her enduring all things
is to be rewarded. In this tragic close, Jamieson
was anticipated by Mrs Hampden Pye, in
her 'Earl Walter,' 1771, Evans's Old Ballads,
II, 208, 1777. <b>C</b> is given as it appears in Kinloch's
annotated copy of his Ancient Scottish
Ballads, where ten stanzas are inserted to enlarge
and complete the copy published in
1827. This enlarged copy was communicated
to Chambers, and seven of the supplementary
stanzas were introduced into his compilation,
The Scottish Ballads, p. 193. These supplementary
stanzas, some of them certainly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-84" id="Pg_2-84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
we may suppose all, belonged to a copy of
which only the concluding portion, here given
as <b>D</b>, is elsewhere preserved.</p>

<p>The variations in the several versions of
this charming ballad, which has perhaps no
superior in English, and if not in English perhaps
nowhere,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> are not material, and the story
may therefore be given as it runs in <b>A</b>, the
oldest copy. Fair Ellen comes to Child Waters,
and tells him that her gown, which was
too wide, is now too narrow. He bids her be
content and take two shires of land; she would
rather have one kiss from his mouth than
Cheshire and Lancashire both. He must ride
far into the North the next day; she asks to
be his foot-page. This she may be if she
will shorten her gown and clip her locks, so
as not to be known for a woman. He rides
hard all day, and she keeps up with him barefoot.
They come to a broad piece of salt water;
he lets her get through as she can, but
Our Lady bears up her chin. Then he points
out a splendid hall, where are four and twenty
ladies, and the fairest is his love and wife.
God give both good! is all she says. Arrived
there, Ellen takes his horse to the stable. At
bed-time he sends her to the town, to bring
him the fairest lady that can be found, to
sleep in his arms, and to bring this lady in <i>her</i>
arms, for filing of her feet. Ellen lies at the
foot of the bed, for want of other place, and
before dawn is roused by Child Waters to
feed his horse. The pains of travail come on
her in the stable; Child Waters' mother
hears her moans, and bids him get up. He
stands at the stable-door and listens. Ellen
sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Lullaby, dear child, dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would thy father were a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy mother laid on a bier!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This moves even his sturdy heart; he tells
Ellen to be of good cheer, for the bridal and
the churching shall both be on one day.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b> the man relents so far as,
when they are in the water, to ask her to ride.
She will not, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>; he takes her on at a stone
which stands in the middle of the stream, <b>B</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>J</b>. The stream is Clyde in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>J</b>;
the Tay in <b>I</b>. In <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b> he tells her
after they have passed the water, that it is
three and thirty miles to his house; a (poetically)
superfluous and meddling parrot says it
is but three. In <b>C</b>, <b>G</b> he tells her that she will
have a serving-man for a husband, and in <b>H</b>
that he has already wife and bairns.</p>

<p>One stroke in <b>A</b>, the sending of Ellen to
fetch a woman from the town, is wanting in
the other versions, decidedly to their advantage.
This exaggeration of insult, submitting
to which only degrades the woman, is paralleled,
though not quite reached, by the paramour
in the forest in the otherwise exquisitely
refined tale of The Nut-Brown Maid. As for
the ballad, the disagreeable passage may be
an insertion of some unlucky singer, and the
perfect truth to nature and remarkably high
taste of The Nut-Brown Maid, in every other
particular, would almost drive us to assume an
interpolation in this case too.</p>

<p><b>E</b> 1, 2, 16, <b>F</b> 2, 3 show contact with the
ballad of 'Lizzie Lindsay;' the passing of
the water, particularly in <b>E</b> 8-12, with <a href="#Ballad_110">'The
Knight and Shepherd's Daughter</a>;' and again,
<b>H</b> 21.</p>

<p>An exceedingly popular Scandinavian ballad
is manifestly of the same source, though the
story is told in a very different way, the cruel
trials to which the woman's love is put being
entirely lacking: <b>Danish</b>, 'Jomfru og Stalddreng,'
Grundtvig, V, 171, No 267, <b>A-A</b>.
<b>Swedish</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Liten Kerstin StalldrÃ¤ng,' Afzelius,
II, 15, No 33; <b>B</b>, 'Stolts Botelid StalldrÃ¤ng,'
Afzelius, II, 20, No 34; <b>C-E</b>, 'Liten
Kerstin StalldrÃ¤ng,' Arwidsson, II, 179, No
109, Hofberg's Nerikes gamla Minnen, p. 254,
Ãberg in Aminson, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 28; <b>F-I</b>, from Cavallius
and Stephens's manuscript collection, Grundt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-85" id="Pg_2-85">[Pg 85]</a></span>vig,
V, 217 f; <b>J</b>, 'Liten Kerstin och Dane-Peter,'
WigstrÃ¶m, Folkdiktning, <b>I</b>, 66, No
32. <b>Norwegian</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Liti Kersti som stalldreng,'
Landstad, p. 605, No 78; <b>B-E</b>, Grundtvig,
V, 218-20; <b>F</b>, Landstad, p. 605, note.
(Several of these are only a verse or two.)
Danish <b>A-F</b> are from manuscripts of the sixteenth
or seventeenth century; <b>G</b> was printed
at the end of the seventeenth; the other copies
are from recent tradition, but nevertheless
point to a higher antiquity than those which
were taken down earlier. There is naturally
much variation in details among so many
copies, and it will be sufficient to indicate the
general character of the story. A young
woman, who may be called Kirstin, clips her
hair and puts on man's clothes, seeks service
at court, and is taken as stable-boy, at the
instance of a man (often the king's son, or of
other high rank) who may be called Peter,
with whom she, in some copies, seems to have
had a previous connection. Peter, as an accommodation,
lets the stable-boy sleep with
him. In the course of time Kirstin cannot do
duty any more, cannot buckle on spurs, is ill
and requires woman's assistance, which the
queen renders. She gives birth to twins in
the stable (among the horses' legs, as in English,
<b>B 30</b>, <b>J 30</b>). A merry wedding follows.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Another Scandinavian ballad has a limited
resemblance to 'Child Waters:' <b>Danish</b>, 'Den
trofaste Jomfru,' Grundtvig, IV, 494, No 249,
<b>A-I</b>; 'Den fredlÃ¸se,' Kristensen, II, 191, No
57 (A-C), <b>J-L</b>. <b>Swedish</b>, <b>A</b>, 'De Sju Gullbergen,'
Afzelius, III, 71, No 79; <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, from
Cavallius and Stephens's collection, Grundtvig,
IV, 507f. <b>Norwegian</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Herre Per
og stolt Margit,' Landstad, p. 590, No 74;
<b>B</b>, Herr' Nikelus, Landstad, p. 594, No 75.
The ballad begins like Danish 'Ribold og
Guldborg' and 'Kvindemorderen.' A knight
carries off a maid, making her fine promises,
among which gold castles commonly figure.
He takes her over a very wide piece of water,
an arm of the sea, on his horse in most versions;
in Danish <b>B</b>, <b>K</b> they swim it. When
they come to land, she asks Where are the
promised castles? Danish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. He tells her that he is a penniless
outlaw (wanting in Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>); she
offers the gold she has brought with her to
buy him his peace (wanting in Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>,
Norwegian <b>B</b>). He tells her he has another
love; she is willing to be their servant (wanting
in Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>I</b>, Norwegian <b>B</b>).
Here he ceases his trial of her; he is a royal,
or very opulent, person, she is to have a troop
of servants, the castles are not in the air, and
all ends happily.</p>

occurs in Jamieson's '<a href="#Version_69_F">Clerk Saunders</a>,' I, 84,

Sweet Willie?" may probably have been suggested

For the conclusion of <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, see No 7,
I, 96 ff.</p>

<p>Fair Janet, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b> [Annet, Maisry], loving
Sweet Willie, and on the point of becoming
a mother by him, is destined by her father
to marry a French lord, <b>A</b>; a Southland lord,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>. She implores Willie to fly with her
over sea, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; to good green wood, <b>F</b>. They
set sail, but her condition obliges her to return,
<b>B</b>; her time comes before they can get
away, <b>C</b>. She bears a child.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> To avoid discovery,
the babe is taken to Willie's mother,
who very readily assumes charge of it. Scarcely
has the child been born, when Janet's father
comes with orders to busk the bride, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b> (?), <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. She begs to be tenderly handled,
as not being in good plight. They attire
her gayly, and she selects Willie to lead her
horse, or ride before her on her horse, to
church, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. Her cheek is pale, her color
goes and comes; it is suspected, and even suggested,
that she has borne a bairn, or is near
to doing so, <b>A</b> 22, <b>C</b> 14, <b>D</b> 10, <b>E</b> 11, <b>F</b> 25.
She seeks to clear herself by an ambiguous
oath, <b>E</b> 12, <b>G</b> 26, 27; Willie does this for her,
<b>G</b> 11. After dinner, or supper, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, dancing
is in order. Janet makes excuses to her brothers,
her father, the bridegroom's man, and declines
very decidedly the bridegroom's own
invitation, with marked asperity in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>.
But with Willie she will dance though her
heart should break in three. She takes three
turns, and falls down dead. Willie gives the
key of his coffer to his man, and bids him tell
his mother that his horse has slain him. He
would not survive Janet in any pure and full
form of the story, and does not in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>.</p>

<p>'Sweet William,' Motherwell's Minstrelsy,
p. 307, borrows some stanzas at the beginning
from 'Fair Janet.'</p>

<p>There are points of resemblance between
'Fair Janet' and a ballad very popular in
Scandinavia and in Germany, which demand
notice, though they may not warrant the assumption
of community of origin.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian ballad is: <b>Danish</b>, 'Kong
Valdemar og hans SÃ¸ster,' Grundtvig, No
126, III, 63 ff, 911 f, <b>A-I</b>; <b>G</b> from a sixteenth-century

last from recent tradition. <b>Icelandic</b>, 'SoffÃ­u
kvÃ¦Ã°i,' Ãslenzk FornkvÃ¦Ã°i, No 52, II, 152,

must be put, at latest, in the seventeenth century,
though some are first met with in the
eighteenth. <b>FÃ¤roÃ«</b>, a single copy, almost
Danish, from the beginning of this century,

<p>According to the Scandinavian story, a king
is informed by his queen, her inexorable enemy,
that Kirstin, his sister, has just borne a child.
The king sends for Kirstin, who is at some
distance, to come to him immediately. She is
obliged to make the journey on horseback.
Upon her arrival the king puts her to a variety
of tests, among these a long dance. Kirstin
comes off so well that her brother says the
queen has belied her. The queen then bares
Kirstin's breast and makes milk flow from it.
The king hereupon sends for heavy whips,
and flogs his sister to the point of death. In
the Icelandic and FÃ¤rÃ¶e versions Kirstin dies
of the dance, in her brother's arms. In the
Swedish versions and in Danish <b>I</b> the king is
Kirstin's father, not her brother. The Norwegian
versions and Swedish <b>F</b>, <b>H</b> have a
false conclusion: Kirstin survives, and is
united to her lover. In Danish <b>A</b> the king
had, before he learned the state of things,
promised his sister to the son of the King of
England, and in Danish <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish <b>F</b>, and
the FÃ¤rÃ¶e ballad, Kirstin's lover is an English
prince, who, in Danish <b>H</b>, comes to claim his
mistress, and, finding her dead, kills the king.
In Swedish <b>A</b> Kirstin dances with four, dances
with five, dances with all the men of the
court, and in Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>H</b> she tires out successively
all the courtiers, the king, and the
queen.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, far the best preserved of the German
versions, makes a hunter ask a count for his
sister Annchristine. Being refused, as an unequal
match, he tells the count that his sister,
for all her nobility, has borne a child. The
count maintains Annchristine to be a maid.
The hunter says, Send for her, and see. The
young lady is required to come on horseback.
When her brother sees her approaching, with
her long hair flowing, his confidence is strengthened.
The hunter says, Make her dance. She
dances seven hours, and her brother finds reason
to continue of the same mind as before.
The hunter says, Let us tighten her lacing,
and, when that is done, milk springs from her
breasts. Her brother gives her the choice between
whipping and the sword. She chooses
the former. He beats her till liver and lungs
spring from her body. She then calls on him
to stop; Prince Frederick of England is his
brother-in-law. The count is much troubled,
and promises everything if she will live. But
Annchristine dies, and presently Prince Frederick
appears. He has heard of what the count
has done, cuts him to bits, and gives him to
the crows.</p>

<p>In the other German versions the informant
is generally of low rank, and sometimes professes
to be father of the child. In <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>K</b> he is a kitchey-boy, a personage who
plays no insignificant part in romantic story.
The coming on horseback is wanting. The
long dance is found in <b>B-F</b>. The father of
the child is always the English King, who
runs the brother through with his sword, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, or otherwise gives him his due.</p>

<p>The slight resemblance and the great difference
of the Scottish story are apparent. Fair
Janet has to go a certain distance on horseback,
at a time when she is peculiarly ill fitted
to do so, like the hapless Kirstin of the Scandinavian
ballads and the German <b>A</b>, and she
dies from dancing in her weak condition, as
the lady does in the Icelandic and FÃ¤rÃ¶e ballad.
But both the ride and the dance are incidental
to her forced marriage, and neither
the ride nor the dance is employed as a test,
as the dance always is in the other ballad, and
as the ride is expressly devised to be in German
<b>A</b> 6. The Scottish Janet is not constrained
to dance, nor does she dance down all
the men in the room. She declines every invitation
except Willie's, and this, in some cases,
she (very naturally and touchingly) encourages
or incites; and her vital powers give way
after three turns. All the unspeakably ferocious
features of the Norse and German ballads
are wanting, and the bound which divides
the pathetic from the horrible is never passed.</p>

<p>A Breton ballad, 'Ar C'homt Gwillou,'
'Prinses ar Gwillou,' 'Le Comte Guillou,' 'La
Princesse Le Guillou,' Luzel, II, 6-15, in three
versions, has the probation by dancing. A
count or prince, returning to his mistress after
a considerable absence, happens to hear a shep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-103" id="Pg_2-103">[Pg 103]</a></span>herdess
singing a song, of which he himself is
unfortunately the subject. The lady has had
a child. Fearing to encounter her injured
lover, she tries to pass off a younger sister for
herself, but, as may be imagined, this desperate
artifice does not succeed. She is told what
is said of her, and hopes she may melt like
butter if ever she had daughter or son. The
count calls out, Play up, musicians, that we
may see how this damsel will step out. The
young woman pleads that she is suffering from
fever, and cannot dance just now, but the
count strikes her on the breast so that milk
spurts on her gown, <b>A</b>. He kills her.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>There is also a Magyar ballad, in which a
jealous or offended lover makes his mistress
dance till her boots are full of blood, as Kjersti's
are in Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>: 'Darvas Kis Clement,'
Aigner, p. 110.</p>

ballad will require to be

ballad to Mrs Arrot: compare Popular Ballads,
I, pp 66 and 59. His copy is repeated
by Motherwell, p. 71. <b>C</b>, of which no account
is given by Motherwell, is hardly more
than a variety of <b>B</b>. There is a copy in the
Abbotsford manuscript, "Scottish Songs,"
which is more considerably tampered with, in
the way of change, omission, and insertion.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>All the versions are in accord as to the material
points of the story. Lady Maisry rejects
the suit of all the lords in the north
country, <b>A</b>; she has given her love to an English
lord. Her lover's seat is Strawberry Castle,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>; Adam's Tower, <b>H</b>; he lives at
London, <b>G</b>. Maisry has been at Strawberry
Castle for a time, and has there learned some
unco lair, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> It is discovered that Maisry
goes with bairn. Her brother, <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>, father,
<b>I</b>, informed to this effect, requires her to renounce
her English lord, but she refuses; her
father offers her the choice of marrying an auld
man or burning, <b>D</b>. In the other versions the
family set about preparations for burning her
without attempting any arrangement. Maisry,
warned of her approaching fate, calls for a
boy to carry word to England, and a light-footed
and heartily devoted young messenger
takes her errand. The English lord asks if
his biggins are broken, his towers won, or is
his lady lighter, and is told that his lady is to
be burnt for him that very day. Horses are
instantly saddled: a black, a brown, are foundered,
a milk-white [a dapple-gray], fair fall
the mare that foaled that foal! holds out, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. In <b>D</b> fifteen stout steeds are burst,
yet the little foot-page runs aye before, crying,
Mend your pace an you may! Maisry,
in the flames, hears her lover's horn, hears his
bridle ring, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>. "Beet on!" she
cries; "I value you not one straw. Mend up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-113" id="Pg_2-113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the fire, brother; I see him coming that will
soon mend it up to thee."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In <b>A</b>, <b>H</b> she cries
out, when her lover appears, that if her hands
had been free she would have cast out his
young son. He leaps into the fire for a last
kiss; her body falls apart, <b>B-G</b>. He threatens
an awful retaliation: he will burn father and
mother, and the chief of all her kin (who, no
doubt, had been concerned in this auto da fÃ©).
Vengeance glutted, he will throw himself into
the flames, <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>; he will take the pilgrim's
cloak and staff, <b>C</b>. The foot-page shall be
heir of his land, <b>C</b>; he will remember the
bonny boy that ran the errand, <b>E</b>.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Maisry, Margery, is the heroine's name in
<b>A</b>, <b>D-H</b>, <b>J</b>; Janet in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; Susie Cleland in <b>I</b>.
The hero has a name only in <b>A</b>, Lord William,
and in <b>H</b>, Prince James.</p>

<p>'Lady Maisry' has a limited, and perhaps
quite accidental, resemblance to the Scandinavian-German
ballad spoken of in the preface
to '<a href="#Ballad_64">Fair Janet</a>.' The lapse of the heroine
is visited with a fearful death at the hand of
brother or father, and the lover who was
partner to her trespass appears on the scene
immediately after, and takes his revenge. A
kitchey-boy is informant in <b>A</b>, as in some versions
of the German story.</p>

<p>The regular penalty for incontinence in an
unmarried woman, if we are to trust the authority
of romances, is burning. This, according
to the well-known passage in Ariosto, Orlando
Furioso, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 58, 59, was l'aspra legge
di Scozia, empia e severa, though it might be
as difficult to point out a law to that effect in
any European code as a corresponding patria

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> In 'The Infanta and Don Galvan,' the lady, like Fair
Janet, calls to Don Galvan to come and take her new-born
child and carry it to his mother to nurse. The father superintends
in person the preparation of the pile in 'Dona Ausenda.'
In the romances of Conde Claros, the infanta, when
she learns that she is to be burnt, asks for some one "que
haya comido mi pan," to carry a letter to Don Claros, and a
page does the errand, just as in the Scottish ballad: Primavera,
II, 374, etc. Often a bird, hawk, dove, takes the message,
as in 'Sweet William,' Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p.
307. Don Claros asks the infanta of her father in marriage,
and is refused (because she is promised). He then
informs the emperor that the infanta is with child. It is a
<i>hunter</i> who informs the father of the love of his daughter
and the count in one of the romances, Primavera, II, 362.
Compare the German ballad, in '<a href="#Ballad_64">Fair Janet</a>,' p. 102. When
the lover gets his letter, in Briz, IV, 43, he reminds us of
Sir Patrick Spens:

<p><b>C</b> was furnished Jamieson from Herd's
MSS by Scott, and underwent a few slight
changes in publication. Jamieson inquired
through the Scots Magazine, October, 1803,
p. 699, for the conclusion, which is wanting,
but unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>The only variation of much moment in the
five versions of this tragedy is that, in <b>C</b>, the
bridegroom and the lover are not brothers,
but uncle and nephew. Some inconsistencies
have been created in the course of tradition.
The bride's insisting on having twenty men
before her and twenty on each side, ere she
will go to kirk, not to mention the extravagance
of twenty milk-white doves above her
head, <b>C</b> 22,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> is incompatible with her aversion
to the "weary wedding," and with her language
about the bridegroom's gifts in <b>C</b> 4, 5,
<b>D</b> 4-6, <b>E</b> 8-10. There is much confusion at
the end. After the death of the two rivals
the lady, in <b>E</b>, imposes on herself the penance
of begging her bread as a pilgrim for the rest
of her days. This penance we find also in the
two last stanzas of <b>A</b>, and a trace of it in <b>B</b> 20,
<b>D</b> 10. Another, and probably later, representation
is that she went mad, <b>A</b> 30, <b>B</b> 19,
<b>D</b> 9. The two are blended in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>; unless
we are to suppose that Maisry's adopting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-127" id="Pg_2-127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
a beggar's life was a consequence of her madness,
which is not according to the simplicity
of old ballads. That something was due the
unfortunate Lord Ingram, especially if he was
disposed to relinquish his wife to his brother,
<b>B</b> 17, the modern sense of justice will admit;
but that Maisry's remorse on account of the
handsome wedding Ingram had given her
should exceed her grief for Chiel Wyet, <b>A</b> 32,
<b>B</b> 20, <b>D</b> 10, <b>E</b> 43, 44, is as little natural as
romantic, and is only to be explained as an
exhibition of imbecility, whether on her part
or on the part of some reciter who gave that
turn to the story. <b>B</b> confounds confusion by
killing Maisry on the top of all.</p>

<p>The sword laid in bed between man and
woman, <b>B</b> 14, <b>E</b> 30, as a sign or pledge of
continence, does not occur often in popular
ballads. We have it in 'SÃ¼deli,' Uhland, I,
275, No 121, st. 11, and in two of the Swedish
forms of Grundtvig's 'Brud i Vaande,'

23, <b>F</b> 28, <b>J</b> 5, <b>N</b> 42, or makes the table flee,
<b>H</b> 42; so the knight in '<a href="#Ballad_63">Child Waters</a>,' <b>G</b> 18,
the baron in '<a href="#Ballad_83">Child Maurice</a>,' <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and
the mother in '<a href="#Ballad_91">Fair Mary of Wallington</a>,' <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>. Kinmont Willie, st. 9, takes the table
with his hand and gars the red wine spring
on hie. The table, being of boards laid on
trestles, would be easy to ding over or make
flee. Being also narrow, it might be jumped
over, and those in whose way it might be seem
to have preferred to clear it in that fashion,
at least out of Britain. So the Danish Lord
Lovel on hearing of his love's death, spilling
the mead or wine, Kristensen, II, No 20, <b>A</b> 6,
<b>B</b> 10, <b>C</b> 3, <b>D</b> 4; Sir Peter in Afzelius, No 9,
I, 50, Grundtvig, No 210, IV, 220, etc. The
king in the Icelandic Ribbalds kvÃ¦Ã°i, to be
sure, kicks the table away and spills the mead
and wine, Ãslenzk FornkvÃ¦Ã°i, No 16, <b>B</b> 8,
<b>C</b> 2, so that Lord Wayets, Young Beichan, and
others may have taken their cue from that
island. But against this we may put Hervarar
saga, c. 3, Fornaldar SÃ¶gur, I, 516; Olafs saga
hins Helga, c. 50, Keyser and Unger, p. 36;
Grundtvig, Danmarks Folkeviser, No 11, <b>A</b>
23, No 13, <b>B</b> 18, <b>G</b> 15, <b>I</b> 16; etc. In 'Magnus
AlgotsÃ¸n,' Grundtvig, No 181, <b>D</b> 18, the
bride jumps over the table and goes off with
her old love; in Su&#353;il's Bohemian ballads, No
135, p. 131, the bride jumps over four tables
and on to a fifth to get at her first betrothed;
in the Novella della Figlia del Re di Dacia, ed.
Wesselofsky, p. 38, the duke jumps over the
table to get to his wife; in a German ballad
in SchrÃ¶er's Ausflug nach Gottschee, p. 210 f,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-128" id="Pg_2-128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the bridegroom, who has lost the bride, jumps
over the table to get out of the room as soon
as possible; a French gentleman takes a vault
over the table before him, Gautier, Les
ÃpopÃ©es FranÃ§aises, I, 508, ed. 1865, and a
lady in a ludicrous anecdote told in the Zimmerische
Chronik, ed. Barack, 1881, II, 132 f.
But Torello's wife, on the other hand, Decameron,
<span class="smcap">X</span>, 9, throws down the table which bars
her way to her lord, and so does the steward
in 'Sir Orfeo,' v. 576, ed. Zielke.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Ebbe SkammelsÃ¸n, being obliged to absent
himself from his plighted maid for a considerable
time, loses her through the artifices of his
brother [and mother], who pretends first that
Ebbe is unfaithful, and then that he is dead.
Ebbe is warned by a dream that his brother
is about to wed his mistress, goes home in
great haste, and arrives on the wedding-day.
He kills the bride, and then his brother, who,
at the last moment, offers to cede the bride to
him, as Lord Ingram, in <b>B</b> 17, says he meant
to do. Ebbe after this begs his bread, or
goes on a pilgrimage weighted with iron on
his hands and loins; wherein his part resembles
Maisry's. Danske Viser, III, 75, No
120, translated by Prior, II, 380; Arwidsson,
No 33, I, 216, 224, 412; Atterbom's Poetisk
Kalender, 1816, p. 55.</p>

<p>It may be worth noting that Maisry's wedding,
according to <b>B</b> 20, was "in good kirk-door,"
like the five of The Wife of Bath.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_94_94" id="Footnote_94_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> These citations, which might easily be extended, are
many of them repeated from Grimm's RechtsalterthÃ¼mer,
pp. 168-70 of the second edition. Sir Walter Scott has
pointed out that on the occasion of the marriage of Maria
of Burgundy with the Archduke Maximilian, in 1477, the
marriage being by proxy, Ludwig, Pfalzgraf of Vendelz, the
bridegroom's representative, was formally bedded with the
bride, a naked sword being laid between them. Scott also
refers to a play called The Jovial Crew, acted in 1641, in
which one of the characters, to enrage another, proposes to
be his proxy, marry his love for him, and lay a naked cudgel
betwixt them: Sir Tristrem, p. 439, ed. 1833. In an Italian
ballad the sword is reduced to a straw: Wolf, Volkslieder
aus Venetien, No 95, Bolza, No 56, Ferraro, C. p. monferrini,
No 76. In the Spanish and Portuguese romances of
'Gerineldo,' the sultan or king, having found the page asleep
with the infanta, lays his sword between the two and retires:
Duran, Nos 320, 321; Hardung, I, 101.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_95_95" id="Footnote_95_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> Some of the Norse examples were derived from notes of
Grundtvig, three others from Liebrecht. Grundtvig cites an
ordinance of Frederic II of Denmark, dated 1586, to this
effect: Whereas a custom has come in of having a dance
during a wedding-repast, which dance those that sit behind
the tables are asked to as well as others, and therefore are
obliged to step on the tables, on which the victuals are still
standing, and whereas this, indecorous of itself, might even
prove dangerous to women-folk, and others, who should
attempt to jump over the tables, now therefore dancing during
meal-time is forbidden until dishes and tables shall have
been cleared away: IV, 754. The table-jumping above is
mostly done under great excitement, and at weddings, in
order that the right parties may come together; but nimble
young men in England seem to have taken this short way
to their places habitually in old times. Liebrecht cites this
curious passage from the Jests of Scogin, Hazlitt's Shakespeare
Jest-Books, II, 105: "Scogin did mark the fashions
of the court, and among all other things he did mark how
men did leap over the table in the king's hall to sit down at
dinner and supper, which is not used now." The first edition
of Scogin's Jests is of 1565.</p></div></div>

GLASGERION</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_67_A">A</a>.</b> 'Glasgerion,' Percy MS., p. 94; Hales and Furnivall,
I, 248.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_67_B">B</a>.</b> 'Glenkindie,' Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 93.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_67_C">C</a>.</b> Kinloch MSS, III, 139.</p></div>


<p>'Glasgerion' was first printed in Percy's
Reliques, III, 43, 1765, and was not thought
by the editor to require much correction. Certainly
the English ballad is one which it would
be hard to mend. Scottish <b>B</b> is mainly of
good derivation (a poor old woman in Aberdeenshire),
and has some good stanzas, but
Jamieson unfortunately undertook to improve
a copy in which the story was complete, but
"the diction much humbled," by combining
with it a fragment of another version. Dr
John Hill Burton seems, in turn, to have compounded
a portion of the ballad as printed by
Jamieson with a fragment from tradition (<b>C</b>):
Kinloch MSS, III, 147.</p>

<p>Cunningham, Songs of Scotland, II, 32, has
fused Percy's and Jamieson's copies, as Motherwell
remarks, "in a flux of his own which
has disfigured and quite changed the features
of each."</p>

<p>The grete Glascurion is joined in Chaucer's
House of Fame, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 113-118, with the harpers
Orpheus, Orion (Arion), and Chiron, and
with Orpheus again by Gavin Douglas, copying
Chaucer, in his Palice of Honour, I, 21,
vv 15, 16, ed. Small.</p>

<p>Y Bardd Glas Keraint, in English Keraint
the Blue Bard (Blue Bard being an appellation
of a chief bard, who wore an official robe
of blue), is recorded, as Mr Edward Williams
informs us, to have been an eminent poet of
distinguished birth, son of Owain, Prince of
Glamorgan. The English name Glasgerion,
Mr Williams further remarks, differs not half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-137" id="Pg_2-137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
so much from Glasgeraint as most Welsh
names, as written by Englishmen, do from
their true orthography. There is, therefore,
at least no absurdity in the suggestion that
the Glascurion of Chaucer and the Glasgerion
of the ballad may represent the Welsh Glas
Keraint.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>A peasant lad, tailor's lad, who had overheard
the troth-plight of a knight and lady,
anticipates the lover in 'Den fule Bondedreng,'
Kristensen, II, 25-27; 'TorpardrÃ¤ngen,'
Hazelius, Ur de Nordiska Folkens Lif,
p. 138; 'Die Betrogene,' Norrenberg, Des
dÃ¼lkener Fiedlers Liederbuch, p. 79. The adventure
is jocosely treated in the first two, and
does not amount to a tragedy in the other.
A groom forestalls Agilulf, King of the Lombards,
in the Decameron, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 2, again without
a bloody conclusion.</p>

<p>The marvellous power of the harp in <b>B</b> 2,
<b>C</b> 1 is precisely paralleled in the Scandinavian
'Harpans Kraft,' Arwidsson, No 149, II, 311-17;
Afzelius, No 91, III, 144-47; Grundtvig,
No 40, II, 65-68; Landstad, No 51, p. 475;
Ãslenzk FornkvÃ¦Ã°i, No 3, p. 18 f. In these
the fish is harped out of the water, the young
from folk and from fee, the bairn from its
mother's womb, the water from the brook, the
hind from the wood, the horns from the hart's
head, the bark from the tree, the dead out of
the mould, etc., etc. These effects are of the
same nature as those produced by the harp
of Orpheus, and it is to be observed that in
the ballad of 'Harpans Kraft' the harper is
a bridegroom seeking (successfully) to recover
his bride, who has been carried down to the
depths of the water by a merman. We have
had something like these effects in the 'Twa
Brothers,' No 49, <b>B</b> 10, I, 439, where Lady
Margaret harps the small birds off the briers
and her true love out of the grave.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> There
is a fisherman in the Gesta Romanorum who
has a harp so sweet that all the fish in the
water come to his hand: Oesterley, No 85,
p. 413, Madden, No 35, p. 116, No 8, p. 293.
Equally potent is pipe, flute, or song in many
ballads of various nations; the fish come up
from below, the stars are stopped, the brook
rises, the pines vail their top, the deer stops
in its leap, etc., the musician being sometimes
an elf, sometimes an inspired mortal:
'Hr. TÃ¶nne af AlsÃ¶,' Grundtvig, No 34, II,
15, 19, Afzelius, No 7, I, 33, 128; 'ElvehÃ¶j,'
Grundtvig, No 46, II, 107-109, Afzelius, No
95, III, 170, Arwidsson, No 147, II, 301; Kudrun,
ed. Bartsch, sts 379, 381, 388; the Roumanian
'Salga,' 'Mihu Copilul,' 'Vidra,' Stanley,
p. 29, Alecsandri, pp 58, 66, 98 f, the
same, Ballades et Chants populaires, pp 118,
168, Murray, pp 44, 53 f, 83; 'El Poder
del Canto,' MilÃ¡, Romancerillo, No 207, p.
165, Nigra, Rivista Contemporanea, XX, 78;
'Conde Arnaldos,' Wolf and Hofmann, No
153, II, 80. For the soporific effect of such
music, as shown in <b>B</b> 5, <b>C</b> 2, there are parallels
in 'Albred Lykke,' who sings a ballad
which sets everybody asleep but the young
bride who had been stolen from him, Kristensen,
I, 281, No 105, sts 11, 12, II, 259 f,
No 76, sts 13, 14; 'Den fortryllende Sang,'
Grundtvig, No 243, IV, 470, Danish <b>A</b> 12,

MilÃ¡, No 201, p. 151, Briz, I, 117, IV, 15, V,
75; Campbell's West Highland Tales, I, 291 f.</p>

<p>The oath by oak, ash, and thorn, <b>A</b> 18, is
a relic or trait of high antiquity. We have
an oath by the thorn in '<a href="#Version_64_G">Fair Janet</a>,' <b>G</b> 13,
'<a href="#Version_68_K">Young Hunting</a>,' <b>K</b> 26; by corn, grass sae
green and corn, in '<a href="#Version_68_A">Young Hunting</a>,' <b>A</b> 16,
<b>D</b> 19, <b>G</b> 7. It is to be supposed that the tree,
thorn, corn, was touched while swearing, a sod
taken up in the hand. See Grimm's RechtsalterthÃ¼mer,
2d ed., p. 896 f, p. 117 f.</p>

<p><b>J</b>, Scott's version, and naturally the best
known, is described by the editor as made up
from the best verses of Herd's copies, <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>,
with some trivial alterations adopted from tradition.
This account is far from being exact,
for there are many lines in the edition of 1802
which are not found in Herd's copies, and in
the edition of 1833 four additional stanzas, 11,
12, 13, 28. Such portions of Scott's version
as are not found in Herd are here distinguished
by a larger type. <b>K</b> is perhaps a stall
copy, and certainly, where it is not taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-143" id="Pg_2-143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
other versions, is to a considerable degree a
modern manufacture by a very silly pen.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The copy in Pinkerton's Tragic Ballads, p. 84,
is only the first five stanzas of <b>G</b>, a little
altered.</p>

<p>A Scandinavian ballad begins somewhat
like 'Young Hunting,' but ends like 'Elveskud'
or 'Clerk Colvil.' A young man who
has made up his mind to marry is warned by
his mother against the wiles of a former mistress.
He rides to his old love's house and is
welcomed to beer and wine. He tells her that
he is on the way to his bride. She wants a
word with him, or a kiss, and as he leans over
to her on his horse, stabs him to the heart.
He rides home bleeding, pretends that he has
hurt himself by running against a tree, asks
that his bed may be made and a priest sent
for, and dies. <b>Danish</b>, 'Frillens HÃ¦vn,'
Grundtvig, IV, 203 f, No 208, <b>A-D</b>, <b>A</b> from a
manuscript of the 17th century. <b>Swedish</b>, <b>A</b>,
'Herr Magnus,' Afzelius, No 13, I, 67, an
imperfect copy; <b>B</b>, from Cavallius and Stephens'
manuscript collection, <b>C-H</b>, fragments
in the same collection, Grundtvig, IV, 203;
<b>I</b>, 'Herr Samsing,' Eva WigstrÃ¶m, in Hazelius,
Ur de nordiska Folkens Lif, p. 124.
<b>Norwegian</b>, 'Herre Per og GjÃ¶Ã°alin,' a mixed
form, Landstad, p. 564, No 68, and the first
stanza in Lindeman, No 132, No 178.</p>

<p>The place where the dead body of the
knight lies at the bottom of the river is discovered
by candles burning bright, <b>A</b> 22 f, <b>C</b>
19 f, <b>H</b> 8, <b>K</b> 31, 35. Sir Walter Scott supposed
these candles to mean "the corpse-lights... which
are sometimes seen to illuminate
the spot where a dead body is concealed."
He had been informed that the
body of a man drowned in the Ettrick had
been discovered by means of these candles.
Though the language in the ballad is not
quite explicit, owing perhaps to the fact that
the method of detection practised was more
familiar formerly than now, the meaning is
as likely to be that a candle, floated on the water,
would burn brighter when it came to the
spot where the body lay. A candle (a consecrated
one in Catholic countries) stuck in a
loaf of bread, or supported by cork, is still
believed to be efficient for indicating the place
of a drowned body; in England, Henderson,

<p>That the body of a murdered man will emit
blood upon being touched, or even approached,
by the murderer is a belief of ancient standing,
and evidence of this character was formerly
admitted in judicial investigations. See especially
Grimm, RechtsalterthÃ¼mer, 1854, p.
930 f, Bahrgericht, who cites from literature
the Nibelungenlied (1043-45, Bartsch) Hartmann's
Iwein, 1355-64, Shakespeare's Richard
III, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 2, besides instances of legal or
historical description; to which may be added
others furnished by Sir W. Scott, Minstrelsy
III, 190-93, ed. 1833, and Kinloch, Ancient
Scottish Ballads, pp 10-12. See further

<p>There is a sort of <i>judicium ignis</i> in <b>A</b> 26-28,

not burn the innocent bower-woman consumes
her guilty mistress.</p>

<p>'Clerk Saunders' was first given to the
world in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,
II, 33, 1802, and was there said to be
"taken from Mr Herd's MS., with several corrections
from a shorter and more imperfect
copy in the same volume, and one or two conjectural
emendations in the arrangement of
the stanzas." Sir Walter arranged his ballad
with much good taste, but this account of his
dealing with Herd's copies is very far from
precisely accurate. <b>A</b>, the longer of these,
does not end, as here printed, with Margret's
refusal to be comforted, a rather unsufficing
conclusion it must be owned. The story is
continued by annexing the ballad of '<a href="#Ballad_77">Sweet
William's Ghost</a>,' the lack of which in <b>B</b>
makes Scott call that version imperfect. This
sequel, found also in <b>F</b>, is omitted here, and
will be given in the proper place.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Jamieson's,
<b>F</b>, as well as Scott's, is a made-up copy,
"the stanzas where the seven brothers are introduced"
having been "enlarged from two
fragments, which, although very defective in
themselves, furnished lines which, when incorporated
with the text, seemed to improve
it." About one half of <b>G</b> is taken from Herd's
MSS, with trivial alterations. The ghostly visitation
at the end blends 'Proud Lady Margaret'
with '<a href="#Ballad_77">Sweet William's Ghost</a>,' and this
conclusion, not being worth transferring, has
been allowed to stand.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The dream in <b>E</b> 13
may be derived from 'Fair Margaret and
Sweet William.'</p>

<p>The austerities vowed in <b>D</b> 13-15, <b>E</b> 17-20,
found also in <b>A</b> 20-22, <b>G</b> 23-25, make a very
satisfactory termination to the tragedy, and
supply a want that may be felt in <b>B</b>, and in
<b>A</b> as it stands here. The like are found in
'<a href="#Ballad_72">The Clerk's Twa Sons o Owsenford</a>,' 'Bonny
Bee Ho'm,' 'Lord Livingston,' 'The Weary
Coble o Cargill,' and 'The Lowlands of Holland.'
Also in the French ballad of 'La Biche
Blanche,' where a brother, having unwittingly
been the death of his sister, who was maid by
day but hind by night, vows himself to a seven
years' penance:</p>

<p>The king, in 'Kong Valdemar og hans

in a dark house where he shall never see fire
nor light, nor shall the sun ever shine on him,
till he has expiated his monstrous cruelty to
his sister.</p>

<p>So the marquis, in the Romance del Marques
de MÃ¡ntua, swears, till he has avenged
the death of Valdovinos,</p>

<p><b>F</b>, Jamieson's version, connects 'Clerk
Saunders' with a Scandinavian ballad,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> which
seems to be preserved in abbreviated and
sometimes perverted forms, also by other races.
Full forms of this Northern ballad are:</p>

<p><b>Icelandic</b>, 'ÃlÃ¶far kvaeÃ°i,' eight versions,
<b>A-H</b>, Ãslenzk FornkvÃ¦Ã°i, No 34, I, 332.</p>

<p><b>FÃ¤rÃ¶e</b>, 'FaÃ°ir og dottir,' communicated by
Hammershaimb to the Antiquarisk Tidsskrift,
1849-51, p. 88.</p>

<p><b>Norwegian</b>, 'Far aa dÃ³tter,' Bugge, Gamle
Norske Folkeviser, p. 115, <b>A</b> (with two fragments,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>).</p>

<p>A father [king, Icelandic <b>A-H</b>] asks his
daughter if she is ready to marry. She has no
such thought.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> [She swore by God, by man,
that she had never had the thought, had no
private connection, was as clear as a nun; but
nobody knew what was in her mind: FÃ¤rÃ¶e.]
Who, then, he asks, is the fair knight that rode
to your bower? No fair knight, but one of
her knaves. Whose was that horse I saw at
your door? It was no horse, but a hind from
the fell. Who was that fair knight you kissed
at the spring? It was no knight, but her
maid that she kissed. Does her maid wear a
sword at her side? It was no sword, but a
bunch of keys. Does her maid wear spurs?
It was no spurs, but gold on her shoes. Has
her maid short hair? Her plaits were coiled
on her head. Does she wear short clothes,
like men? Maids hold up their coats when
there is a dew. What babe was crying in her
chamber? It was no babe, but her dog.
What was that cradle standing by her bed?
It was no cradle, but her little silk-loom.</p>

<p>In the FÃ¤rÃ¶e ballad the father then rides to
the wood, meets a knight, cuts him in two,
hangs his foot, hand, and head to his saddle,
and returns. Do you know this foot? he
asks. It has often found the way to her chamber.
Do you know this hand? Many a
night it has lain on her arm. Do you know
this head? Many a kiss have the lips had.
In the other versions these bloody tokens are
produced on the spot, with a more startling
effect. The daughter wishes a fire in her father's
house, him in it, and herself looking on.
Instantly a blaze bursts forth, the king is
burnt up, and all that belongs to him. The
daughter sets the fire herself in the FÃ¤rÃ¶e and
the Norwegian ballad. She dies of grief in
Icelandic <b>C</b>, takes to the wood in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> goes
into a cloister in <b>D</b>, <b>G</b> (cf. English <b>C</b>).</p>

<p>A briefer form of this same story is 'Den
grymma Brodern,' Afzelius, No 86, III, 107.
In this a brother takes the place of the father.
After several questions he asks his sister if she
knows the man's hand that hangs at his saddle.
She bursts out into an exclamation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-158" id="Pg_2-158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
grief. 'Thore och hans Syster,' Arwidsson,
No 55, I, 358,[106] has lost its proper conclusion,
for we have not come to the conclusion when
the brother says that his sister's false inventions
will never give out till the sea wants
water, a comment which we also find in the
FÃ¤rÃ¶e ballad (where, however, it is misplaced).
This is the case, also, with 'Det hurtige Svar,'
Danske Viser, No 204, IV, 228<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and 362, but
in the Danish ballad a perversion towards the
comic has begun, the end being:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Brother, would you question more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have answers still in store.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When women lack a quick reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The German Ocean shall be dry.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a <b>Spanish</b> and <b>Portuguese</b> romance a
woman has received a lover in the absence of
her husband. The husband returns before he
is expected, and puts questions similar to those
in the ballads already spoken of: whose horse,
lance, sword, is this? whose spurs, whose arms
are these? and is answered after the same
fashion. There is considerable variety in the
conclusion; the husband kills his wife, kills
the paramour, kills both, both he and his rival
lose their lives, the wife dies of fright, or is
even pardoned. Spanish: 'De Blanca-NiÃ±a,'
Wolf and Hofmann, Primavera, No 136, II,
52; 'Romance del Conde Lombardo,' the same,
No 136 a, II, 53; 'La adÃºltera castigada,'
MilÃ¡, Romancerillo, No 254, <b>A-M</b>, pp 241-45;
'Lo retorn soptat,' Briz, IV, 183; Fernan
Caballero, La Gaviota, p. 82, ed. Leipzig,
1868.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>In an Illyrian ballad, husband, wife, and a
young Clerk are the parties. Three watches
are set to give notice of the husband's return,
one in the field, one in the house-court, one
before the chamber. They give due warning,
but the woman, like Lady Barnard, in '<a href="#Ballad_81">Little
Musgrave</a>,' will not heed. After some questions
and evasions the husband strikes off her
head: 'NevÃ©rnost,' Vraz, Narodne PÃ©sni Ilirske,
p. 72; 'Bestrafte Untreue,' A. GrÃ¼n,
Volkslieder aus Krain, p. 41.</p>

<p>Nothing could be easier than to give these
questions, prevarications, and comments a humorous
turn, and this is done in a large number
of ballads: see 'Our good man came hame
at een.'</p>

<p>The two ballads which immediately follow
have connections with 'Clerk Saunders.'</p>

been such a conclusion to 'Clerk Saunders.' It may be
mentioned, though not as an argument, that there was a
ballad in Boccaccio's time (of which he cites the first two
lines), on the story of G. iv, N. 5, of the Decamerone; a tale
in which three brothers kill their sister's lover, and bury the
body in a solitary place, and his ghost appears and informs
the sister of what had happened.</p></div>

two other ballads, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, of the same series, which lack the

finds a young child that has been left on or in the cleft of a
rock, takes it with him, and rides to his daughter's bower.
He asks his daughter who the fair swain is that he has

<p>'Willie and Lady Maisry' has much in
common with '<a href="#Ballad_69">Clerk Saunders</a>.' The chief
point of difference is that of Willie's killing
Maisry's brother and the guard, <b>B</b> 22-24.
Here the ballad has probably been affected by
another, now represented in English only by a
very corrupt version, '<a href="#Ballad_71">The Bent sae Brown</a>,'

THE BENT SAE BROWN</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 30.</p></div>


<p>'The Bent sae Brown' combines the
story of '<a href="#Ballad_69">Clerk Saunders</a>' with that of another
ballad, not found in an independent form in
English, but sufficiently common in Danish
and Swedish; whence the non-tragical conclusion,
for the killing of a certain number of
brothers is not regarded as a very serious
matter by the heroine, whether in English or
Norse. The introduction and conclusion, and
some incidental decorations, of the Scottish
ballad will not be found in the Norse, but are
an outcome of the invention and the piecing
and shaping of that humble but enterprising
rhapsodist who has left his trail over so large
a part of Buchan's volumes.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>A youth has passed the night with his love,
either in her bower or in a wood. When they
are about to part in the morning, she begs him
to be on his guard against her seven brothers,
on his way through the wood and over the
heath. He makes light of the danger, and in
the wood meets the seven brothers. They
demand how he comes to be there, and he
feigns to have been out with his hawk and
hound, to have been coursing hares. No, they
say, you were with our sister last night, and
asked no read of us. He makes no denial;
but her will was as good as his. They ask
whether he will fly or fight. He has no
thought of flight, kills all seven, and goes
back to his love. She will not forsake him
for killing her brothers; nor would she, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, had he killed her father too.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_108_108" id="Footnote_108_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> Several of Buchan's ballads, says Sir Walter Scott,
Minstrelsy, I, 87, ed. 1833, "are translated from the Norse,
and Mr Buchan is probably unacquainted with the originals."
Scott seems to have meant only that the ballads in
question had a Norse origin, not that they were deliberately
translated within what we may call historical times. In this
particular instance the resemblances with the Norse are remarkably
close, but the very homeliness of the Scottish ballad
precludes any suspicion beyond tampering with tradition.
The silliness and fulsome vulgarity of Buchan's versions
often enough make one wince or sicken, and many of them
came through bad mouths or hands: we have even positive
proof in one instance of imposture, though not of Buchan's
being a conscious party to the imposture. But such correspondences
with foreign ballads as we witness in the present
case are evidence of a genuine traditional foundation.
</p>
<p>
Stanzas 25, 26 are remarkably like <b>F</b> 3, 5 of 'Earl Brand,'
the Percy copy, and may have served in some Scottish version
of the 'Douglas Tragedy.'
</p>
<p>
Stanzas 36-41 are borrowed from the '<a href="#Ballad_110">Knight and Shepherd's
Daughter</a>.' Folly could not go further than in making
the mother clip her locks and kilt her clothes, as in 36: unless
it be in making a boat of a coat and a topmast of a cane, as
in 3, 4.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_110_110" id="Footnote_110_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_110_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> In Danish <b>B</b> the maid has grace enough to weep for her
brothers seven: "and almost more for the knight." But this
last line is probably taken up from another ballad. In 'Herr
Helmer,' a ballad which has some of the traits of 'Ribold,'
Afzelius, No 54, II, 178, 226, Arwidsson, No 21, I, 155, Eva
WigstrÃ¶m, Folkdiktning, I, 25, and the same, SkÃ¥nska Visor,
p. 1, Helmer kills six of his love's seven brothers, and is treacherously
slain by the seventh, whom he has spared. The
seventh brother cuts off Helmer's head and takes it to his
sister. A Danish version of 'Herr Helmer,' Danske Viser,
No 209, IV, 251, ends differently: the seventh brother offers
his sister to Helmer as ransom for his life.</p></div></div>

THE CLERK'S TWA SONS O OWSENFORD</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_72_A">A</a>.</b> 'The Clerk's Twa Sons o Owsenford,' Kinloch
MSS, V, 403.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_72_B">B</a>.</b> 'The Clerks o Owsenfoord,' Dr Joseph Robertson's
Note-Book, "Adversaria," p. 67.</p>

North of Scotland, I, 281.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_72_D">D</a>.</b> 'The Clerks Two Sons of Oxenfoord,' Motherwell's
MS., p. 433.</p></div>


<p><b>A</b>, as sung, had a sequel of six stanzas,
which is found separately and seems to belong
with another ballad, 'The Wife of Usher's
Well.' Robert Chambers combined <b>A</b> with
Buchan's version, <b>C</b>, and the six concluding
stanzas with '<a href="#Ballad_79">The Wife of Usher's Well</a>,' and
divided his ballad into two parts, "on account
of the great superiority of what follows over
what goes before, and because the latter portion
is in a great measure independent of the
other:" The Scottish Ballads, pp 345-50.
His second reason for a division is better than
his first. It is quite according to precedent
for a ballad to end with a vow like that in <b>A</b>
17, <b>D</b> 14: see '<a href="#Ballad_69">Clerk Saunders</a>.'</p>

<p><b>D</b> has some amusing dashes of prose, evidently
of masculine origin: "They thought
their father's service mean, their mother's no
great affair," 2; "When he was certain of the
fact, an angry man was he," 6; "That I may
ride to fair Berwick, and see what can be
done," 8. We have here a strong contrast
with both the blind-beggar and the housemaid
style of corruption; something suggesting the
attorney's clerk rather than the clerk of Owsenford,
but at least not mawkish.</p>

<p>There are ballads both in Northern and in
Southern Europe which have a certain amount
of likeness with 'The Clerk's Twa Sons,' but
if the story of all derives from one original,
time has introduced great and even unusual
variations.</p>

<p>In the Scottish ballad two youths go to
Paris to study, and have an amour with the
mayor's daughters, for which they are thrown
into prison and condemned to be hanged.
The Clerk, their father, comes to the prison,
asks them what is their offence, and learns
that it is a little dear bought love. He offers
the mayor a ransom for their lives, and is
sternly refused. The mayor's two daughters
beg for their true-love's lives with the same
bad success. The students are hanged, and
the father goes home to tell his wife that they
are put to a higher school. She, <b>A</b> [he, <b>D</b>],
vows to pass the rest of her days in penance
and grief.</p>

<p>A very well known German ballad, found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-174" id="Pg_2-174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
also in the Low Countries and in Scandinavia,
has the following story.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> A youth is lying in a
dungeon, condemned to be hanged. His father
comes to the town, and they exchange words
about the severity of his prison. The father
then goes to the lord of the place and offers
three hundred florins as a ransom. Ransom
is refused: the boy has a gold chain on his
neck which will be his death. The father
says that the chain was not stolen, but the
gift of a young lady, who reared the boy as a
page, or what not. There is no dear bought
love in the case. The father, standing by the
gallows, threatens revenge, but his son deprecates
that: he cares not so much for his life as
for his mother's grief. Within a bare half
year, more than three hundred men pay with
their lives for the death of the boy.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>A Spanish and Italian ballad has resemblances
with the Scottish and the German,
and may possibly be a common link: 'Los
tres estudiantes,' MilÃ¡, Romancerillo, p. 165,
No 208, <b>A-L</b>, previously, in Observaciones,
etc., p. 104, No 6, 'Los estudiantes de Tolosa;'
'Los estudians de Tortosa,' Briz y Candi,
I, 101; 'Gli scolari di Tolosa,' Nigra, Rivista
Contemporanea, XX, 62. Three students
meet three girls, and attempt some little jests
with them: ask them for a kiss, MilÃ¡, <b>H</b>;
throw small pebbles at them, MilÃ¡, <b>D</b>; meet
one girl on a bridge and kiss her, Nigra. For
this the girls have them arrested by an accommodating
catchpoll, and they are hanged by
a peremptory judge. The youngest student
weeps all the time; the eldest tries to console
him; their brother serves a king or duke, and
if he hears of what has been done will kill
judge, constable, and all their scribes. The
brother gets word somehow, and comes with
all speed, but the three clerks are hanged before
he arrives. He gives the town of Tolosa
to the flames, the streets run with the blood
of the judge, and horses swim in the blood of
the girls, MilÃ¡, <b>C</b>, Briz; the streets are washed
with the blood of women, walls built of the
heads of men, MilÃ¡, <b>A</b>; etc.</p>

<p>In a pretty passage in Buchan's not altogether
trustworthy version, <b>C</b> 35-38, the clerks
ask back their faith and troth before they die.
For this ceremony see 'Sweet William's
Ghost.'</p>

<p>The English version of this ballad, 'Lord
Thomas and Fair Ellinor,' given, with alterations,
in Percy's Reliques, III, 82, 1765,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> is a
broadside of Charles the Second's time, printed
for I. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passenger,
and licensed by L'Estrange, who was censor
from 1663 to 1685. This copy has become
traditional in Scotland and Ireland. The
Scottish traditional copy, 'Lord Thomas and
Fair Annet,' given by Percy in the Reliques
(unfortunately with some corrections, but
these cannot have been many), is far superior,
and one of the most beautiful of our ballads,
and indeed of all ballads. 'Fair Margaret
and Sweet William,' "a more pathetic story of
the man who loves one woman and marries
another," begins in the same way, with the
last long talk before parting. The conclusion
is that the forsaken maid dies of grief,
not by the hand of her incensed rival, and it
is most natural that the two stories should be
blended in tradition, as they are here in <b>E-H</b>,
<b>E</b> 31 ff, <b>F</b> 27 ff, <b>G</b> 24 ff, <b>H</b> 37 ff belonging to
'<a href="#Ballad_74">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>.'</p>

<p>There is a copy of 'Lord Thomas and Fair
Ellinor,' written over for the ballad-mongers,
and of course much less in the popular style,
in Pepys, IV, 48, No 45, and Roxburghe, II,
553, with the title 'The Unfortunate Forrester,
or, Fair Eleanor's Tragedy.' In this Fair
Ellinor stabs herself and Lord Thomas then
kills himself with the same dagger.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Norse ballads have the story of 'Lord
Thomas and Fair Annet,' coming very close
in details. Those forms which are nearest to
the English resemble more the mixed versions,
<b>E-H</b>, than the simple, <b>A-D</b>. But in none of
the Norse ballads is love thwarted because it
stands upon the choice of friends. A man
abandons a woman who is in all but the name
his wife, and who regards herself, and is
evidently regarded by others, as standing in
no dishonorable relation to him. There is
again a bifurcation in the catastrophe. The
forsaken mistress submits and hangs herself
in the one case, in the other she takes a fierce
revenge. The latter conclusion may well, as
Grundtvig holds, be the more original, but the
ballads which have the other will here be put
first, as being nearer to the English.</p>

<p>Sir Peter and Liten Kerstin sit at table
talking merrily, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. Peter informs
Kerstin that he is to be married. She says
she shall not fail to be present; he, that the
wedding will be too far away for anybody to
come. She shall come, if asked, though it be
in Rome, <b>B</b>. If you come, says Peter, you
must not wear your gold. She will wear it,
for it was got by no dishonor, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. Peter
rides off, Kerstin wrings her hands: alack for
the maid that trusts a loon! He makes the
preparations for his bridal, and she orders her
clothes, which are of the richest description,
all pearls and gold.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> She has her horse shod,
as in English, <b>B</b> 21, <b>C</b> 12, <b>E</b> 22. When she
enters the hall, wives and maids stand up, <b>B</b>.
She pours wine for the guests. The bride
asks who she is, and is told that it is Sir
Peter's mistress.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> She has more gold on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-181" id="Pg_2-181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
kirtle's hem, says the bride, than all that Sir
Peter owns. Why, if he had her, did he come
seeking me? After the usual long delay the
bride is conducted to the bride-house, Kerstin
carrying the torch before her. Kerstin even
puts the bride to bed. She leaves the room,
saying, <b>A</b>, I trow I shall come here no more,
goes into the orchard, and hangs herself with
her hair. Sir Peter is informed of what has
happened, rushes to the orchard, takes Kerstin
down, has a grave dug deep and broad, sets
his sword against a stone, and runs on it.
The next day, as so often, there are three
dead, Sir Peter, Kerstin, and the bride, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>.
In <b>C</b>, Peter hangs himself on the same tree.</p>

<p>Not so moving, but considerably more
powerful and original, is the other termination
of the story. In <b>E</b>, after Kerstin has lighted
the bride to the bride-house, she draws a knife
and kills Peter. She tells the bride that this
should have been her death too, had she not
spoken her so fair. In <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, she sets fire to
the house and burns the bride on the bridegroom's
arm.</p>

<p>A Southern ballad has something of the outline
of the English and Norse, and sounds like
a thin echo of them. <b>A.</b> PoÃ©sies populaires
de la France, MS., III, fol. 158, Burgundy. <b>B.</b>
Buchon, NoÃ«ls et Chants p. de la Franche-ComtÃ©,
p. 90, No 31, 'J'ai fait un rÃªve.' <b>C.</b>
Beaurepaire, La PoÃ©sie p. en Normandie, p.
50. <b>D.</b> AmpÃ¨re, Instructions, p. 34, Bretagne.
<b>E.</b> Guillon, Chansons p. de l'Ain, p. 161,
'Chante, rossignolet.' <b>F.</b> Arbaud, Chants p.
de la Provence, II, 139, 'Lou premier Jour de
Mai.' <b>G.</b> Ferraro, Canti p. monferrini, p. 8,
No 7, 'Il primo amore.'</p>

<p>A youth is obliged by his father to give up
his love for a bride who is less beautiful but
richer. He has a dream that his love is
dead, and carries her a rose, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>. He invites
her to the wedding: she will not come to the
ceremony, but to the dance. She has three
gowns made for the occasion, the third embroidered
with gold, or of gold stuff. She
falls dead while dancing: she falls on the
right, he on the left. In <b>G</b>, after his love has
died, the bridegroom draws his sword and kills
himself. <b>C</b> and one copy of <b>D</b> have the phenomenon
of the sympathetic plants, as in
English <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>.</p>

<p><b>E</b> 3 is a sort of commonplace when unequal
matches are in question. So in a fragment in
Herd's manuscripts, I, 55, II, 187:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I hae nae houses, I hae nae lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I hae nae gowd or fee, Sir;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am oer low to be your bryde,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your loon I'll never be, Sir.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again Motherwell's MS., p. 37. It is
Lady Grey's answer to King Edward in the
Third Part of Henry VI, III, 2:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I know I am too mean to be your queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet too good to be your concubine.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So Crescentia, the Koloczaer Codex, MailÃ¡th
u. KÃ¶ffinger, p. 260, v. 565 ff.</p>

<p>With regard to <b>B</b> 20, 'I'll na put on the
dowie green,' Kinloch remarks that green is
considered unfortunate in love matters, the
couplet running,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-182" id="Pg_2-182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Green is love deen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yellow's forsaken;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>whereas blue is looked upon as a most fortunate
color: "blue is love true." "To be
married in a green colored dress is ominous of
misfortune, for according to the proverb:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They that marry in green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sorrow is soon seen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And no young woman in the North would wear
that color on her wedding day. An old lady
of my acquaintance, whose marriage had
proved unfortunate, used seriously to warn
young women to beware of being married in
green, for she attributed her own misfortunes
solely to her having been married in a green
gown, which she had put on contrary to the
sage advice of her seniors, in whose minds the
belief was more firmly rooted, and who had
wished her to wear in its stead a blue dress,
as being the more lucky color. To dance in
green stockings is a proverbial phrase applied
to an elder sister when the younger is first
married, intimating that she may mourn her
hapless fate, as she has now no chance of being
married. To dream of green is believed
to be the presage of misfortune." Kinloch
MSS, I, 15 f.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_74_C">C</a>.</b> Percy Papers; communicated by Rev. P. Parsons,

<p><b>A</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> are broadside or stall copies, <b>a</b> of
the end of the seventeenth century, <b>b</b> "modern"
in Percy's time, and they differ inconsiderably,
except that <b>a</b> has corrupted an important
line.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Of <b>d</b>, Percy says, Since the first
edition some improvements have been inserted,
which were communicated by a lady of the
first distinction, as she had heard this song repeated
in her infancy. Herd, in The Ancient
and Modern Scots Songs, 1769, p. 295, follows
Percy. As Percy has remarked, the ballad is
twice quoted in Beaumont and Fletcher's
'Knight of the Burning Pestle,' 1611. Stanza
5 runs thus in Act 2, Scene 8, Dyce, II, 170:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When it was grown to dark midnight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all were fast asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In came Margaret's grimly ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And stood at William's feet.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first half of stanza 2 is given, in Act 3,
Scene 5, Dyce, p. 196, with more propriety
than in the broadsides, thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You are no love for me, Margaret,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I am no love for you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fifth stanza of the ballad, as cited in
'The Knight of the Burning Pestle,' says the
editor of the Reliques, has "acquired an importance
by giving birth to one of the most
beautiful ballads in our own or any language"
[that is, 'Margaret's Ghost'], "the elegant
production of David Mallet, Esq., who, in the
last edition of his poems, 3 vols, 1759, informs
us that the plan was suggested by the four
verses quoted above, which he supposed to be
the beginning of some ballad now lost."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The
ballad supposed to be lost has been lately re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-200" id="Pg_2-200">[Pg 200]</a></span>covered,
in a copy of the date 1711, with the
title 'William and Margaret, an Old Ballad,'
and turns out to be substantially the piece
which Mallet published as his own in 1724,
Mallet's changes being comparatively slight.
'William and Margaret' is simply 'Fair Margaret
and Sweet William' rewritten in what
used to be called an elegant style. Nine of
the seventeen stanzas are taken up with a
rhetorical address of Margaret to false William,
who then leaves his bed, raving, stretches
himself on Margaret's grave, thrice calls her
name, thrice weeps full sore, and dies. See
The Roxburghe Ballads, in the Ballad Society's
reprint, III, 671, with Mr Chappell's remarks
there, and in the Antiquary, January, 1880.
The ballad of 1711 seems to have been founded
upon some copy of the popular form earlier
than any we now possess, or than any known
to me, for the last half of stanza 5 runs nearly
as it occurs in Beaumont and Fletcher (see also
<b>B</b> 7), thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In glided Margaret's grimly ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And stood at William's feet.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Fair Margaret and Sweet William' begins
like '<a href="#Ballad_73">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,' and from
the fifth stanza on is blended with a form of
that ballad represented by versions <b>E-H</b>. The
<i>brown</i> girl, characteristic of '<a href="#Ballad_73">Lord Thomas
and Fair Annet</a>,' has slipped into <b>A</b> 14, 15,
<b>B</b> 8, of 'Fair Margaret and Sweet William.'
The catastrophe of 'Fair Margaret and Sweet
William' is repeated in '<a href="#Ballad_75">Lord Lovel</a>,' and it
will be convenient to notice under the head of
the latter, which immediately follows, some
ballads out of English which resemble both,
especially in the conclusion.</p>

<p><b>I</b> is made up of portions of several ballads.
The first stanza is derived from 'Sweet William's
Ghost,' the second and third possibly
from some form of 'Death and the Lady,'
4-11 from '<a href="#Ballad_65">Lady Maisry</a>.' The eighth stanza
of <b>E</b> should, perhaps, be considered as taken
from '<a href="#Ballad_73">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,' since in
no other copy of 'Lord Lovel' and in none of
'<a href="#Ballad_74">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>' does the
hero die by his own hand.</p>

<p>In '<a href="#Ballad_74">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>,' as
also in '<a href="#Ballad_73">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,' a
lover sacrifices his inclination to make a marriage
of interest. In 'Lord Lovel' the woman
dies, not of affection betrayed, but of hope too
long deferred, and her laggard but not unfaithful
lover sinks under his remorse and
grief. 'Lord Lovel' is peculiarly such a ballad
as Orsino likes and praises: it is silly
sooth, like the old age. Therefore a gross
taste has taken pleasure in parodying it, and
the same with 'Young Beichan.' But there
are people in this world who are amused even
with a burlesque of Othello.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>There are several sets of ballads, very common
in Germany and in Scandinavia, which,
whether they are or are not variations of the
same original, at least have a great deal in
common with 'Lord Lovel' and '<a href="#Ballad_74">Fair Margaret
and Sweet William</a>.'</p>

<p>Of these, one which more closely resembles
the English is 'Der Ritter und die Maid,' of
German origin, but found also further north.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>A knight and maid have been together till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-205" id="Pg_2-205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
morning. She weeps; he tells her that he
will pay for her honor, will give her an underling
and money. She will have none but
him, and will go home to her mother. The
mother, on seeing her, asks why her gown is
long behind and short before, and offers her
meat and drink. The daughter refuses them,
goes to bed, and dies. So far there is no dallying
with the innocence of love, as in the
English ballad; the German knight is simply
a brutal man of pleasure. But now the knight
has a dream, as in 'Fair Margaret and Sweet
William;' it is that his love has died. He
bids his squire or groom to saddle, and rides
to find out what has happened. On his way
he hears an ominous bell; further on he sees
a grave digging; then he meets men carrying
a bier. Set down the bier, he cries, that I
may see my love. He turns back the cloth
and looks at the dead. She has suffered for
him, he will suffer for her. He draws his
sword and runs it through his heart. They
are buried in one coffin, or in the same grave.
In some of the ballads lilies rise from the
grave; in a Swedish version ('Jungfruns
dÃ¶d'), a linden, the leaves of which intermingle.</p>

<p>Next to this we may put a Norwegian and
a Swedish ballad, which, having perhaps lost
something at the beginning, cannot safely be
classed: 'MaarstÃ­g aa hass mÃ¶y,' Bugge, p.
127, No 26, A, B; 'Herr Malmstens drÃ¶m,'
Afzelius, III, 104, No 85. MaarstÃ­g dreams
that his love's gold ring has got upon another
finger, that her gold belt is off her lithe waist,
her cloak or her hair is cut to bits, her shoes
are full of blood; Malmsten that his love's
heart breaks. The pages are ordered to saddle,
and MaarstÃ­g, or Malmsten, rides to find
what there is in the dream. MaarstÃ­g encounters
two maids, who are just from a wake.
"Who is dead?" "MaalfrÃ­, thy sweet love."
He rides on, meets the bier, bids the bearers
set it down, and looks at the dead. Let them
dig the grave, he cries, wide and deep, it shall
be his bride-house; let them dig the grave
deep and long, that is where bride and bridegroom
shall go. He sets his sword against a
stone, and falls on it. With slight variations,
the course of the story is the same for Malmsten.
Another Swedish ballad, 'Den sÃ¶rjande,'
Djurklou, p. 106, No 7, lacks even so
much introduction as the dream. The lover
orders his horse, hears the funeral bell, sees
the grave-digging, meets the bier, looks at his
dead mistress, and kills himself. A fragment
in Dybeck's Runa, 1845, p. 15, begins with
the ride and stops short of the death.</p>

<p>These last ballads apparently give us the
middle and end of a story which has also
some sort of beginning in the following: Danish,
'Den elskedes DÃ¸d,' Kristensen, II, 39,
No 20, A-D, and in many unprinted copies
from oral tradition, besides two from MSS of
the sixteenth century, communicated to me by
Grundtvig; Swedish, 'Hertig Nils,' Arwidsson,
II, 21, No 72, 'Peder Palleson,' Arwidsson,
No 71, II, 18, 437; Norwegian, 'Herr
Stragi,' Landstad, p. 537, No 61.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> A lover and
his mistress have parted, have been long
parted. She is sick, dying, or even dead. In
the Danish manuscript copies we are distinctly
told that she has grieved herself to death on
his account. Word is sent him by carrier-pigeons,
a bird, a page; or he is informed by
a spae-wife (Landstad). He leaps over the
table, spilling mead and wine (Kristensen),
and rides faster than the doves fly. The rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-206" id="Pg_2-206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of the tale is much as before, with those minor
diversities that are to be expected. The lover
commonly kills himself, but dies of heart-break
in 'Peder Palleson' and one of the sixteenth
century Danish copies. In the latter he hears
the bells, says he shall never arrive alive, dies
without the house and she within; in the
former the maid dies in the upper room, the
swain on the wild moor. In the Danish manuscript
copies the man is laid south in the
churchyard, the maid north [west, east], two
roses spring from their breasts and span the
church-roof, and there they shall stay till
doom; in Kristensen it is two lilies, in Arwidsson
a linden.</p>

<p>With these last may belong a German ballad
of a young Markgraf, who marries a very
young wife, goes for her mother upon the
approach of a threatening childbirth, and,
returning, has encounters similar to those in
'Der Ritter und die Maid.' In some instances
it is a Reiter, or JÃ¤ger, "wohlgemuth," not
married, or in secret relations with his love,
who, coming to a wood or heath, hears a bell
that alarms him; etc. In the end he generally
kills himself, sometimes dies of a broken
heart. Lilies in several cases rise from the
young woman's grave, or their grave.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>A Romaic ballad has the characteristic features
of the English, German, and Scandinavian
stories, with a beginning of its own, as
these also have: '<a title="[Gk:  HÃª Eugenoula]"> &#7977; &#917;&#965;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#945;</a>,' '<a title="[Gk: Ho Charos kai hÃª
KorÃª]">&#8009; &#935;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#7953; &#922;&#959;&#961;&#951;</a>,' etc. (1) Zambelios, p. 715, 2=Passow,
No 415; (2) Passow, No 418; (3) Fauriel,
p. 112, No 6=Passow, No 417; (4) Marcellus,
II, 72=Passow, No 414; (5) Chasiotis, p.
169, No 5; (6) Passow, No 416; (7) Aravandinos,
p. 285, No 472; (8) Tommaseo, III,
307 f; (9) Jeannaraki, p. 239, No 301; and
no doubt elsewhere, for the ballad is a favorite.
A young girl, who has nine brothers and
is betrothed (or perhaps newly married) to
a rich pallikar, professes not to fear Death.
Death immediately shows his power over her.
Her lover, coming with a splendid train to
celebrate his nuptials, sees a cross on her mother's
gate, a sign that some one has died. In
(2) he lifts a gold handkerchief from the face
of the dead, and sees that it is his beloved.
Or he finds a man digging a grave, and asks
for whom the grave is, and is told. "Make
the grave deep and broad," he cries; "make
it for two," and stabs himself with his dagger.
A clump of reeds springs from one of the
lovers, a cypress [lemon-tree] from the other,
which bend one towards the other and kiss
whenever a strong breeze blows.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>In a Catalan ballad, a young man hears
funeral bells, asks for whom they ring, is
told that it is for his love, rides to her house,
finds the balcony hung with black, kneels at
the feet of the dead, and uncovers her face.
She speaks and tells him where his gifts to
her may be found, then bids him order the
carpenter to make a coffin large enough for
two. He draws his dagger and stabs himself;
there are two dead in one house! 'La mort
de la Nuvia,' Briz y Candi, I, 135, MilÃ¡, Romancerillo,
p. 321 f, No 337 <b>A</b><sub>ll</sub>, <b>B</b><sub>ll</sub>; found also
in Majorca.</p>

<p>As will readily be supposed, some of the incidents
of this series of ballads are found in
traditional song in various connections.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_120_120" id="Footnote_120_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_120_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> It can scarcely be too often repeated that such ballads
as this were meant only to be sung, not at all to be recited.
As has been well remarked of a corresponding Norwegian ballad,
'Lord Lovel' is especially one of those which, for their
due effect, require the support of a melody, and almost equally
the comment of a burden. No burden is preserved in the
case of 'Lord Lovel,' but we are not to infer that there never
was one. The burden, which is at least as important as the
instrumental accompaniment of modern songs, sometimes,
in these little tragedies, foreshadows calamity from the outset,
sometimes, as in the Norwegian ballad referred to, is a
cheerful-sounding formula, which in the upshot enhances by
contrast the gloom of the conclusion. "A simple but life-like
story, supported by the burden and the air, these are
the means by which such old romances seek to produce an
impression:" Landstad, to 'Herr Stragi,' p. 541.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>A</b>, never as yet published, is from a manuscript
of the first half of the last century.
<b>B</b>, the earliest printed copy, was given by
Herd, from his manuscript, in 1776, with his
usual fidelity. Scott followed, in 1802, with
a copy obtained from Mrs Brown by Alexander
Fraser Tytler in 1800, introducing six
stanzas from <b>B</b> and five from <b>F</b>, and a few
readings from two recited copies. This compounded
copy is the one that is most generally
known. Jamieson printed, in 1806, <b>D</b>, a
version written down from Mrs Brown's recitation
in 1783, giving it not quite <i>verbatim</i>, as
he says (he changes, for instance, Rochroyal
to Lochroyan), but in general adhering to his
text. <b>E a</b>, the copy principally used by Scott,
is, to a considerable extent, a repetition of <b>D</b>,
but is by no means an imperfectly remembered
version of its predecessor (which was
written down seventeen years earlier), filled
out by Mrs Brown's improvised inventions.
<b>E a</b> has stanzas not found in <b>D</b>, two of which
occur in <b>B</b>, and is to be regarded as a blending
of two independent versions known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-214" id="Pg_2-214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Mrs Brown, which no doubt had much in common,
though not so much as <b>D</b> and <b>E a</b>. The
whole of the fragment <b>F</b> has not been published
hitherto, but five of the eight stanzas
are interpolated into Scott's copy, including
the two last, which are shown by the very
style to be spurious. Fairy charms have been
exercised on Lord Gregory, according to the
final stanza of <b>F</b>, and Lord Gregory calls his
dame "witch mother" in <b>C</b> 10. But there
appears to be no call for magic or witchcraft
in the case. A man who is asleep is simply
not informed by an ill disposed mother that a
woman whom he would like to see is at the
door; that is all.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p><b>A</b>, the oldest copy, has a preliminary history
wanting in the others. Isabel of Rochroyal
has a dream about her lover. She
orders her horse, to ride till she comes to some
hold. She meets a company, who ask her
questions about a first and a second young
may, which <i>she</i> seems to understand, but
which are not made intelligible to us. They
then ask whether she be Isabel of Rochroyal,
and she answers that she is that same lady,
banished from kith and kin; why, we are not
informed, but we might conjecture that it
would be on account of her relations with
Love Gregory. She is directed to Gregory's
castle, tirls at the pin, and begs admission.
Gregory's mother answers as and for her son,
and demands proofs of her being the lass of
Rochroyal. These are given, and the mother
says that Gregory is gone to sea. Hereupon
Isabel breaks out into exclamations as to her
helpless condition; who will take care of her?
who will be the bairn's father till Gregory
come home? The mother replies that she
will do all that is necessary for her, but there
is none to be her bairn's father till Gregory
return. This is in itself unnatural, since the
mother is hostile to her son's love, and it is
counter to what we read in the other versions.
In <b>B</b> as in <b>A</b>, to be sure, the lass is said to
be banished from her kin, but her kin nevertheless
show a disposition to do all that is
in their power in the way of kind attentions.
The other copies say nothing of her family
being alienated. The father in <b>D</b> even furnishes
his daughter with a bonny ship, to go
to her true-love. If we seek to reconcile these
accounts, we must take the banishment as a
separation for which only the fates are responsible,
and suppose that verses are lost in <b>A</b>
after 17 which narrated Annie's return to her
own family. The lass says, st. 22, that she
will set her foot on ship-board, having been
told by the mother, st. 17, that Gregory is on
the sea. Gregory, in turn, has his dream, that
his love has been knocking at the door, and
his mother tells him that she has not been
gone half an hour, and gets his curses for not
informing him. Gregory orders his swiftest
horse, to ride till he comes to some hold, and
presently meets a funeral train who are carrying
his love to burial. This conclusion, found
also in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, is that of '<a href="#Ballad_75">Lord Lovel</a>' and '<a href="#Ballad_74">Fair
Margaret and Sweet William</a>,' and must perhaps
be set aside as not the original one. In
<b>B</b> Gregory kills himself, as Lord Lovel does in
one copy, <b>E</b>.</p>

<p>The whole story as <b>A</b> actually stands, notwithstanding
that the lass says she will take
ship, seems to pass on land. Two different
relations may have been confounded. In the
other versions Love Gregory is somewhere over
sea, and in <b>B</b>, <b>F</b> his lass is indebted for his direction,
not to a company who are raking over
the lea, but to a sea-rover, who shows a consideration
not to be looked for from his class.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
The maid, repulsed by Gregory's mother, and
supposing herself to be cast off by Gregory
himself, sails away from his castle, and in <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b> encounters a storm, and is wrecked. In <b>D</b>
Gregory rushes to the strand near which his
castle lies, sees Annie sailing away, witnesses
the wreck of her vessel, plunges into the sea
and brings her body to land, and dies of heartbreak.
So in <b>E</b>, with the difference that Annie's
body is thrown ashore by the waves, and
that the tale does not finish with the death of
Gregory, which we know must have followed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-215" id="Pg_2-215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>Why the lovers are parted, why Gregory
winna come to the lass, and she must go to
him, is not accounted for in <b>C-G</b>. We may
deduce from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, though the story in
these versions as we have it is not altogether
consistent, that the lass was banished from
kith and kin on account of her connection
with Gregory (which in <b>B</b> 16 and <b>H</b> 9 is said
to have been irregular) and flying to her lover,
found no acceptance with his mother.</p>

<p>Cunningham has rewritten this ballad, Scottish
Songs, I, 298, and several songs have been
composed on the story: by Burns and Dr
Wolcott (Peter Pindar), Thomson's Select
Melodies of Scotland, I, 37, ed. 1822; Jamieson,
Popular Ballads, I, 46; and by an anonymous
writer in a London periodical, cited by
Dixon, Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient
Ballads, p. 99.</p>

<p>Roch- or Rough-royal, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, Ruchlawhill,
<b>C</b>, I have not found, but there is a Rough
castle in Stirlingshire. Loch Ryan runs up
into the north-west corner of Wigtown, a shire
at the south-west extremity of Scotland. Aughrim
is in the county of Roscommon, Ireland.</p>

<p>As the mother in this ballad, feigning to be
her son, requires the lady at the gate to legitimate
herself by mentioning some of the tokens
which have been exchanged between her and
her lover, so in other ballads a wife demands
conclusive proofs that a man claiming to be
her long absent husband is what he pretends
to be. E. g., some forms of the French ballad
of 'Germaine:'</p>

<p>"I find myself quite unable to arrange the
fragments of the 'Lass of Aughrim' in anything
like decent symmetry. The idea that
I have of the arrangement is that the Lass
begins with a sort of soliloquy, lamenting her
condition; that she sings this at the door of
a castle, shut against her; that she hears
Gregory's voice within, and then appeals to
him for admittance; and then comes the dialogue
between them.</p>

<p>"The [third] stanza, as I heard the thing sung,
was repeated as a burden after all the succeeding
stanzas, even when the Lad and not
the Lass speaks; but I do not think it followed
the [first two] stanzas; they were a
sort of introduction." <i>Mr Mahon, December,

<p>Ramsay's copy, <b>A</b>, was reprinted by Percy,
Reliques, 1765, III, 128, and by Herd, 1769, p.
194, 1776, I, 76. Percy remarks that the concluding
stanza seems modern. There can be
no doubt that both that and the one before it
are modern; but, to the extent of Margaret's
dying on her lover's grave, they are very likely
to represent original verses not remembered
in form. <b>B</b> constitutes, in Herd's MSS, and
<b>F</b>, in Jamieson's Popular Ballads, the termination
of a copy of '<a href="#Ballad_69">Clerk Saunders</a>.' Scott appended
the three stanzas given as <b>G</b> to the
later edition of his <i>rifacimento</i> of the copies
of 'Clerk Saunders' in Herd's MSS, and says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-227" id="Pg_2-227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of them: "I am informed by the reciter that
it was usual to separate from the rest that
part of the ballad which follows the death of
the lovers, as belonging to another story."
The first part of <b>F</b> was evidently derived from
'Proud Lady Margaret,' No. 47.</p>

<p>Motherwell notes, Minstrelsy, p. lxiii, 6,
that in recited copies he had heard this stanza
repeated, "which does not occur in printed
copies" (and can easily be spared), after <b>A</b>
14.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>The story of this ballad seems to have become
disordered in most of the versions. <b>A</b>
alone, the first published, has perhaps retained
the original form. The principal idea is, however,
preserved in all the full versions, <b>A-E</b>;
the dead lover returns to ask back his unfulfilled
troth-plight. His mistress, not knowing
that he is dead, demands that he shall first
come within her bower and kiss her, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>.
He answers that if he does this her days will
not be long. She persists; he shall take her
to kirk,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and wed her with a ring, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>. He
then tells her distinctly that he is dead, and
she returns to him his faith and troth. She
streaks her troth on a long wand and gives it
to him through a window, <b>B</b>. In <b>A</b> she
stretches out her white hand, "to do her
best;" in <b>C</b> "takes up" her white hand, and
strikes him on the breast; in <b>E</b> takes her
white hand and smooths it on his breast; all
of which are possibly corruptions of the ceremony
performed in <b>B</b>. In <b>D</b> she takes a silver
key and strikes him three times on the
breast. She follows the dead till he comes to
his grave, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> (?) <b>F</b>, which is wrongly
said in <b>A</b>, <b>E</b> to be far beyond the sea. She
asks if there is room for her in his grave, and
is told there is not, <b>A</b>, <b>F</b> [there is room, <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>]. She dies at his grave, <b>A</b>; is told that
her days will not be long, <b>F</b>; in <b>G</b>, goes weeping
away.</p>

<p>Margaret will not give William back his
faith and troth, in <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, unless he resolves
certain questions about the state of the dead;
what becomes of women that die in travail;
where the women go who hang themselves
for sin; where unbaptized children. Mere
curiosity does not sort well with this very
seriously conceived ballad, and these passages
have probably grown out of a not unnatural
inquiry on the part of Margaret as to her
lover's personal state, extended in <b>E</b> 12 to
"tell me the pleasures o heaven, and pains o
hell how they be." The scene at the grave in
<b>C</b> 11-13 may be judged grotesque, but is not
trivial or unimpressive. These verses may be
supposed not to have belonged to the earliest
form of the ballad, and one does not miss them
from <b>A</b>, but they cannot be an accretion of
modern date.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott informs us, in the Advertisement
to The Pirate, that the lady whose
affections had been engaged by Goff, the historical
prototype of Cleveland, "went up to
London to see him before his death, and that,
arriving too late, she had the courage to request
a sight of his body; and then touching
the hand of the corpse, she formally resumed
the troth-plight which she had bestowed."
"Without going through this ceremony," Scott
goes on to say, "she could not, according to
the superstition of the country, have escaped
a visit from the ghost of her departed lover,
in the event of her bestowing upon any living
suitor the faith which she had plighted to the
dead."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>'Sweet William's Ghost' has much in common
with one of the most beautiful and celebrated
of the Scandinavian ballads, and may
well be a different development of the same
story:</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> 'FÃ¦stemanden i Graven' ('Aage
og Else'), Grundtvig, No 90, II, 492-97, III,

from which the others do not materially vary,
a man dies just as he is to be married. His
love grieves for him passionately. The dead
hears her under the ground, comes to her
bower with his coffin on his back, and knocks.
She lets him in after he has proved himself to
be "a spirit of health" by uttering the name
of Jesus, combs his hair, and asks him how it is
under the black earth (cf. English, <b>E</b> 12). It
is like the bliss of heaven. May she follow
him into his grave? It is like blackest hell.
Every time she weeps for him his coffin is
filled with lappered blood. But when she
sings and is happy, his grave is all hung with
rose-leaves. The cock crows, the white, the
red, the black; he takes up his coffin and goes
wearily back to the graveyard. His love follows
through the mirk wood (so Swedish <b>A</b>
9, cf. English <b>B</b> 11), to the churchyard, and
into the church. Then his yellow hair falls
away, his rosy color wans. He bids her go
home and never weep for him more. "Look
up at the sky, the night is going;" and as she
looks he slips into his grave. She goes sadly
home, prays God that she may not live out a
year and a day, falls sick, and dies within a
month.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian ballad agrees in many
particulars with the conclusion of the second
lay of Helgi Hundingsbani in the older Edda.
Helgi, having been slain by SigrÃºn's brother,
is bitterly bewailed by SigrÃºn. He quits his
barrow to come to her. SigrÃºn will kiss him,
but his hair is thick with hoar-frost, he is
drenched in blood, and how is this? These
are the grim tears that SigrÃºn has shed, every
one of which falls on his breast. SigrÃºn says
she will sleep in his arms as though he were
alive, and goes into the barrow with him.
The end of the story is lost; according to a
prose tradition which professes to supply the
close, SigrÃºn soon died of grief. The source
of the later ballads is perceptible here.</p>

<p>In the English ballad the dead lover returns
of his own motion, simply to ask back his
troth; in the Scandinavian, his betrothed
grieves him out of his grave, "hon sÃ¶rjer sin
fÃ¤steman ur graf," and the object of his visit
is to admonish her to restrain her tears, which
prevent his happy repose. A fragmentary
story with this turn, which perhaps may even
have been a variety of 'Sweet William's
Ghost,' will be found in the ballad which follows
this.</p>

<p>In a somewhat popular German ballad, 'Der
todte Freier,' a dead man comes to the window
of his betrothed in the night and calls
her. She does not recognize him; says he
smells of the ground. He has been eight
years in the ground, and that may be. He
bids her summon father, mother, and friends,
for her bridegroom has come. She is decked
as for her wedding; at the first sound of the
bell makes her will or receives the sacrament,
and dies at the second.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>A young man goes to the grave of his betrothed
and asks his love-tokens back; she
refers him to her mother, and tells him she
will join him in a year: Haupt u. Schmaler,
I, 88, No 55. This returning of gifts by the
dead is not an infrequent phenomenon: &#268;elakowskÃ½,

<p>The vow in the second stanza of all the

and elsewhere (see p. 156f of this volume),
and <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b> 4, 5, <b>C</b> 3, 4 are nearly a repetition

that this brief little piece is an aggregation
of scraps. But these repetitions would
not strike so much if the ballad were longer,
and we must suppose that we have it only in
an imperfect form. Even such as it is, however,
this fragment has a character of its own.
It exhibits the universal popular belief that
excessive grieving for the dead interferes with
their repose. We have all but had 'The Unquiet
Grave' before, as the conclusion of two
versions of 'The Twa Brothers:'</p>

</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott has remarked that the belief
that excessive grieving over lost friends
destroyed their peace was general throughout
Scotland: Redgauntlet, Note 2 to Letter XI.
See also Gregor's Notes on the Folk-Lore of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-235" id="Pg_2-235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the North-East of Scotland, p. 69. We have
recent testimony that this belief survives in
England (1868), Folk Lore Record, I, 60. It
was held in Ireland that inordinate tears would
pierce a hole in the dead: Killinger, Erin, VI,
65, 449 (quoting a writer that I have not
identified).</p>

<p>The common notion is that tears wet the
shroud or grave-clothes. Scott relates a story
of a Highlander who was constrained to come
back and say to a kinswoman: My rest is disturbed
by your unnecessary lamentation;
your tears scald me in my shroud.</p>

<p>Mrs Grant of Laggan tells a similar story.
An only sister had lost an only brother. Night
after night she sat up, weeping incessantly and
calling upon his name. At length her brother
appeared to her in his shroud, and seemed wet
and shivering. "Why," said he, "am I disturbed
with the extravagance of thy sorrow?
Till thou art humble and penitent for this
rebellion against the decrees of Providence,
every tear thou sheddest falls on this dark
shroud without drying, and every night thy
tears still more chill and encumber me." Essays
on the Superstitions of the Highlanders
of Scotland, ed. New York, 1813, p. 95 f.</p>

<p>A dead boy appears to his mother, and begs
her to cease weeping, for all her tears fall
upon his shirt and wet it so that he cannot
sleep. The mother gives heed, her child comes
again and says, Now my shirt is dry, and I
have peace. Grimms, K. u. H. mÃ¤rchen, No
109.</p>

<p>In another form of this tradition a child
has to carry all its mother's tears in a large
pitcher, and cannot keep up with a happy little
band to which it would belong, 'Die Macht
der ThrÃ¤nen,' Erk, Neue Sammlung, III, <span class="smcap">I</span>, No
35=Wunderhorn, IV, 95, Liederhort, p. 8,
No 3, Mittler, No 557; Hoffmann u. Richter,
p. 341, No 290; BÃ¶rner, Volkssagen aus dem
Orlagau, pp 142, 152; or lags behind because
its clothes are heavy with these tears, Geiler
von Kaisersberg's Trostspiegel, 1510, cited by
Rochholz in Wolf's Zeitschrift fÃ¼r deutsche
Mythologie, II, 252; Thomas Cantipratensis,
Bonum Universale, "l. ii, c. 53, Â§ 17," about
1250; or the child collects its mother's tears
in its hands, MÃ¼llenhoff, No 196.</p>

<p>A wife's tears wet her dead husband's shirt
in the German ballad 'Der Vorwirth:' Meinert,
p. 13=Erk's Wunderhorn, IV, 96, Erk's
Liederhort, p. 160, No 46<sup>a</sup>, Mittler, No 555;

158, No 46, Mittler, No 556; Peter, I, 200,
No 15.</p>

<p>Saint Johannes Eleemosynarius and a couple
of his bishops are fain to rise from their
graves because their stoles are wet through
with a woman's tears, Legenda Aurea, c. 27,
Â§ 12, GrÃ¤sse, p. 132, last half of the thirteenth
century (cited by Liebrecht); and Saint Vicelin,
because his robes are drenched with the
tears of his friend Eppo, Helmold, Chronica
Slavorum, l. i, 78, p. 15, ed. Lappenberg, last
half of the twelfth century (cited by MÃ¼llenhoff).</p>

<p>SigrÃºn weeps bitter tears for Helgi's death
every night ere she sleeps. The hero comes
out of his mound to comfort her, but also to
tell her how she discommodes him. He is
otherwise well off, but every drop pierces, cold
and bloody, to his breast: HelgakviÃ°a Hundingsbana
II, 45. So in some of the ballads
which apparently derive from this lay, the
tears of Else or Kerstin fill her lover's coffin
with blood: Grundtvig, II, 495, 497, No 90,
<b>A</b> 17, <b>B</b> 8; Afzelius, I, 31, No 6, st. 14, WigstrÃ¶m,
Folkdiktning, I, 18, st. 9.</p>

<p>Almost the very words of the Highland apparition
in Scott's tale are used by an Indian
sage to a king who is inconsolable for the loss
of his wife; "the incessant tears of kinsfolk
burn the dead, so it is said:" KÃ¢lidÃ¢sas, Raghuvansa,
<span class="smcap">VIII</span>, 85, ed. Stenzler, p. 61 of his
translation. Another representation is that
the dead have to swallow the rheum and tears
of their mourning relations, and therefore
weeping must be abstained from: YÃ¢jnavalkya's
Gesetzbuch, Sanskrit u. Deutsch, Stenzler,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 11, p. 89.</p>

<p>The ancient Persians also held that immoderate
grief on the part of survivors was detrimental
to the happiness of the dead. Weeping
for the departed is forbidden, because the
water so shed forms an impediment before the
bridge TchÃ®navar (over which souls pass to
heaven). Sad-der, Porta <span class="smcap">XCVII</span>, Hyde, Vete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-236" id="Pg_2-236">[Pg 236]</a></span>rum

is, is told: The river that you see before you
is composed of the tears of mankind, tears
shed, against the express command of the Almighty,
for the departed; therefore, when you
return again to the earth inculcate this to
mankind, that to grieve immoderately is in the
sight of God a most heinous sin; and the river
is constantly increased by this folly, every
tear making the poor wretches who float on it
more distant from ease and relief. The Ardai
Viraf Nameh, translated from the Persian, by
J. A. Pope, London, 1816, p. 53 f.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans also reprehend
obstinate condolement as troubling the dead,
and perhaps, if we had the popular views on
the subject, these might be found to have taken
an expression like some of the above. In Lucian
De Luctu, c. 16, the ghost of a son who
had died in the bloom of youth is made to reproach
the disconsolate father in these words:
<a title="[Gk: Ã´ kakodaimon anthrÃ´pe, ti kekragas? ti de moi parecheis pragmata?]">&#8001; &#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#949;,

THE WIFE OF USHER'S WELL</h2>

Border, II, 111, ed. 1802.</p>

<p><b>B</b> forms the conclusion, as already said, to
a beautiful copy of '<a href="#Ballad_72">The Clerk's Twa Sons o
Owsenford</a>,' recited by the grandmother of
Robert Chambers.</p>

<p>A motive for the return of the wife's three
sons is not found in the fragments which remain
to us. The mother had cursed the sea
when she first heard they were lost, and can
only go mad when she finds that after all she
has not recovered them; nor will a little wee
while, <b>B</b> 5, make any difference. There is no
indication that the sons come back to forbid
obstinate grief, as the dead often do. But supplying
a motive would add nothing to the impressiveness
of these verses. Nothing that we
have is more profoundly affecting.</p>

<p>A copy of this ballad in Dryden's Miscellany,
III, 312, 1716, agrees with the one in
Wit and Drollery. That in Ritson's Select
Collection of English Songs, II, 215, 1783,
agrees with Dryden's save in two or three
words. The broadside <b>C a</b> was printed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-243" id="Pg_2-243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Henry Gosson, who is said by Chappell to
have published from 1607 to 1641. If the
lower limit be correct, this is the earliest impression
known.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The other broadsides, <b>C b-e</b>,
are later, but all of the seventeenth century.
Percy inserted the ballad in his Reliques, III,
67, 1765, making a broadside in the British
Museum his basis, and correcting as usual.</p>

<p>Percy remarks: This ballad is ancient, and
has been popular; we find it quoted in many
old plays. Cases cited by him are: Beaumont
and Fletcher's Knight of the Burning Pestle,
<span class="smcap">v</span>, 3, Dyce II, 223, of about 1611:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And some they whistled, and some they sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hey down, down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And some did loudly say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever as the lord Barnet's horn blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Away, Musgrave, away!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again, Sir William Davenant's play 'The
Wits,' where Sir Thwack boasts, "I sing Musgrove,
and for the Chevy Chase no lark comes
near me," Act <span class="smcap">III</span>, p. 194, of ed. 1672; and
'The Varietie,' a comedy, Act <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 1649.
In Beaumont and Fletcher's 'Bonduca,' <span class="smcap">V</span>,
2, Dyce, V, 88, dating before March, 1619,
we find this stanza, which is perhaps <b>A</b> 26,
loosely remembered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She set the sword unto her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Great pity it was to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That three drops of her life-warm blood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Run trickling down her knee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And two stanzas in Fletcher's 'Monsieur
Thomas,' <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 11, Dyce VII, 375, earlier than
1639, may well be <b>A</b> 11, 12 parodied:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If this be true, thou little tiny page,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This tale that thou tellst me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on thy back will I presently hang<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A handsome new livery.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if this be false, thou little tiny page,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As false it well may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with a cudgel of four foot long<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll beat thee from head to toe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jamieson says, in a prefatory note to <b>F</b>,
that he had heard 'Little Musgrave' repeated,
with very little variation, both in Morayshire
and the southern counties of Scotland. All
the Scottish versions are late, and to all seeming
derived, indirectly or immediately, from
print.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> As a recompense we have a fine ballad
upon the same theme, '<a href="#Ballad_82">The Bonny Birdy</a>,'
which is not represented in England.</p>

<p>In the English broadside and most of the
northern versions the lovers try a bribe, a
threat, or both, to make the page keep counsel.
In some of these Musgrave, when detected,
ejaculates a craven imprecation of woe
to the fair woman that lies in his arms asleep,
<b>G</b> 23, <b>H</b> 16, <b>I</b> 14, <b>J</b> 20, <b>L</b> 37. In <b>I</b> the men
are brothers; in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> Musgrave has a wife of
his own; in <b>C</b>, <b>G</b> Lord Barnard kills himself;
in <b>E</b> he is hanged! None of these divergences
from the story as we have it in <b>A</b> are
improvements, but it is an improvement that
the lady should die by stroke of steel as in <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, in exchange for the barbarity
of <b>A</b>. The penance in <b>L</b> is a natural and
common way of ending such a tragedy. The
collecting of the lady's heart's blood in a basin
of pure silver, <b>G</b> 28-30, is probably borrowed
from 'Lammikin,' where this trait is very
effective.</p>

<p>The heathen child, <b>B</b> 13<sup>1</sup>, is a child unchristened.
An unbaptized child seems still
to be called so in Norway, and so is a woman
between childbirth and churching. In modern
Icelandic usage a boy or girl before confirmation
is called heathen, from confusion between
baptism and confirmation: Ivar Aasen,
at the word heiden; Vigfusson, at the word
heiÃ°inn.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<h2><a name="Ballad_82" id="Ballad_82">82</a><br />
THE BONNY BIRDY</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 42; Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 162.</p></div>


<p>Jamieson, in printing this ballad, gave the
husband the name Lord Randal, made many
changes, and introduced several stanzas, "to
fill up chasms." But the chasms, such as
they are, are easily leapt by the imagination,
and Jamieson's interpolations are mere
bridges of carpenter's work. The admirably
effective burden is taken into the story at
stanza 11. As Jamieson remoulds the ballad,
it is no burden, but a part of the dialogue
throughout.</p>

<p>The main part of the action is the same as
in '<a href="#Ballad_81">Little Musgrave</a>.' The superior lyrical
quality of the Scottish ballad makes up for its
inferiority as a story, so that on the whole it
cannot be prized much lower than the noble
English ballad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cunningham has rewritten the ballad in his
own style, pretending, as often, to have known
another recited copy: 'Sir Hugh,' Songs of
Scotland, II, 130.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_83_G">G</a>.</b> Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 18, three stanzas;
Jamieson, in The Scots Magazine, 1803, LXV, 698,
two stanzas.</p></div>


<p><b>A</b> was printed from the Percy manuscript
by Jamieson, in his Popular Ballads, I, 8. Of
<b>B</b> Motherwell says, 1827: "By testimony of a
most unexceptionable description, but which it
would be tedious here to detail, the editor can
distinctly trace this ballad as existing in its
present shape at least a century ago."</p>

<p>In his preface to the copy of the ballad in
the Reliques of Ancient Poetry (<b>F</b>), Percy remarks:
"The following piece has lately run
through two editions in Scotland, the second
printed at Glasgow in 1755, 8vo. Prefixed
to them both is an advertisement, setting forth
that the preservation of this poem was owing
'to a lady, who favored the printers with a
copy as it was carefully collected from the
mouths of old women and nurses;' and 'any
reader that can render it more correct or complete'
is desired to oblige the public with such
improvements. In consequence of this advertisement
sixteen additional verses have been
produced and handed about in manuscript,
which are here inserted in their proper
places." The copy printed in 1755<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and earlier
had already "received very considerable
modern improvements," as Percy goes on to
say, the most noticeable of which is a conclusion
of eight stanzas, in the taste of the middle
of the last century. These, as also the four
stanzas which had been handed about in manuscript,
are omitted from this reprint.</p>

<p>Home's tragedy of Douglas, produced in
Edinburgh in 1756, was founded upon the
story of Gil Morice, and the popularity of
the play seems to have given vogue to the ballad.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
The sophisticated copy passed into recitation,
and may very likely have more or less
infected those which were repeated from ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-264" id="Pg_2-264">[Pg 264]</a></span>lier
tradition. An old woman (Mrs Thomson,
the reciter of <b>E</b>), who was born about the
time when the ballad was printed, told Motherwell
that she had learned 'Chield Morice' in
her infancy from her grandmother, but at a
later period of her life committed to memory
'Gil Morice,' "which began, with young lasses
like her, to be a greater favorite and more
fashionable than the set which her grandmother
and old folks used to sing."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Gray writes to Mason, June, 1757 (?): "I
have got the old Scotch ballad on which Douglas
was founded; it is divine, and as long as
from hence [Cambridge] to Aston."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> He
cites the first fifteen lines.</p>

<p>The copy in Smith's Scottish Minstrel, III,
106, is Herd's (Percy's), with omissions and
changes. 'Child Nourice,' a fragment, in
Buchan's MSS, I, 143, is of recent make.</p>

<p>The name of Barnard, a name, says Aytoun,
quite foreign to Scotland, may have been
adopted from '<a href="#Ballad_81">Little Musgrave</a>.' There is a
marked similarity in the conclusion of the two
ballads.</p>

<p>Aytoun, in his compilation, I, 147, 149, rejects
the two stanzas, <b>F</b> 13, 14, beginning,
"And when he came to broken brigue," as
taken from '<a href="#Ballad_65">Lady Maisry</a>.' These stanzas
are the most favorite of all commonplaces,
and belong as much to one ballad as another.
They occur in one version or another of 'Lord
Ingram,' '<a href="#Ballad_81">Little Musgrave</a>,' 'The Clerk's Twa
Sons,' etc., and wearisomely often in the ballads
in Buchan's collection.</p>

<p>The popularity of 'Gil Morice' since the
middle of the last century has caused the story
to be localized. The green wood, says Motherwell,
was believed to be "the ancient forest
of Dundaff, in Stirlingshire, and Lord Barnard's
castle to have occupied a precipitous
cliff overhanging the Water of Carron, on the
lands of Halbertshire." Gil Morice, "according
to the unvarying traditions of the country,
was remarkable for the extreme length and
loveliness of his yellow hair." Motherwell
considers that the embellishments of the ballad
may have been suggested by these traditions.
But why should not these traditions
have been derived from the embellished ballad?
There had already been nearly fourscore
years for them to grow up at the date of
the publication of his Minstrelsy.</p>

Laing showed Motherwell a copy, without place or date, with
the title: Gill Morice, An Ancient Scots Poem. The foundation
of the tragedy called Douglas, as it is now acted in
the Concert-Hall, Canongate. There was no material difference
between this edition and that which was reprinted in
the Reliques, except that it lacked the four stanzas which
Percy introduced. Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 259, note.
</p>
<p>
In Herd's MSS, I, 7, II, 70, there are half a dozen more
stanzas, from The Weekly Magazine, August 13, 1772, which
continue the story still further. My lady flings herself over
a craig, my lord seeks death in battle. But, as Sir Walter
Scott notes in the margin, these verses are "formed on the
conclusion of Douglas, which tragedy is founded on the
original ballad." These stanzas are printed by Jamieson, I,
21.
</p>
<p>
Mr Macmath has communicated to me an early copy of
'Gil Morice,' without place or date, in conjunction with
a parody, entitled The Seven Champions of the Stage,
printed in 1757, which satirizes Parson Home's efforts to get
his Agis and his Douglas acted by Garrick. This copy
of 'Gil Morice' might be another edition of that which Mr
Laing possessed. Its variations, which are of slight consequence,
will be given in the notes to <b>F</b>.</p></div>

that a copy learned from print may be transformed in this
way, but it is certain that old tradition does not come to a
stop when a ballad gets into print. Mrs Thomson's account
of the matter Aytoun does not heed. It is difficult to understand
why Aytoun printed the stanzas from Percy's Reliques,
at I, 149 f, 2d ed., except as a simple courtesy to his correspondent.</p></div>

<p><b>A a</b> is wrongly said by Stenhouse, The
Scots Musical Museum, IV, 213, to have appeared
in Ramsay's Miscellany in 1724. It is
not even in the edition of 1733, but, according
to Mr Chappell, was first inserted in that
of 1740. Ramsay's copy is repeated in Herd,
1769, p. 29, 1776, I, 19, Johnson's Museum,
p. 230, No 221, and Ritson's Scotish Song,
II, 196. <b>C</b> was perhaps derived from Ramsay,
but possibly may have come down by
purely oral tradition. Some later copies of <b>B</b>
have Reading Town for Scarlet Town (Chappell).</p>

<p>The Scottish ballad is extended in Buchan's
MSS, I, 90, Motherwell's MS., p. 671, to forty-one
stanzas. In this amplified copy, which
has no claim to be admitted here, the dying
lover leaves his watch and gold ring, his Bible
and penknife, a mill and thirty ploughs, nine
meal-mills and the freights of nine ships, all
to tocher Barbara Allan. This is the ballad
referred to by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe
in Stenhouse's edition of the Museum, IV,
300*, as sung by the peasantry of Allandale.
Doubtless it was learned by them from some
stall-print.</p>

<p>Pepys makes this entry in his Diary, January
2, 1666: "In perfect pleasure I was to
hear her [Mrs Knipp, an actress] sing, and especially
her little Scotch song of Barbary Allen."
Goldsmith, in his third essay, 1765, p.
14, writes: The music of the finest singer is
dissonance to what I felt when an old dairy-maid
sung me into tears with 'Johnny Armstrong's
Last Good-night,' or 'The Cruelty of
Barbara Allen.'<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

YOUNG BENJIE</h2>

<p>'Verkel VejemandsÃ¸n,' Grundtvig, IV,
151, No 198, invites a comparison with 'Young
Benjie,' although the ballads, in the form in
which they are now extant, are widely divergent.
Verkel VejemandsÃ¸n, seeing maid
Gundelild shining in her virgin crown, makes
a fiendish vow to rob her of it. He rides up
to her house and asks where her father and
mother are. They are away from home. He
carries her off on his horse into the thickest of
a wood, and bids her hold the beast while he
makes a bed of leaves. He loses her in the
thicket, and cannot find her, though he looks
for her a day and two days. She goes to the
strand and throws herself into the sea, saying,
It was a very different bride-bed that my
mother meant me to have. She is drawn out
in a fisherman's net. Verkel swears that he
has not seen her for eight years, but he is
convicted of his crime, on evidence not given,
and "clothes three stakes;" that is, he is
hanged, and parts of his body are exposed on
the wheels which crown the three posts of a
gallows.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott's observations on the passage
in which the drowned maid reveals the
author of her death are too interesting to be
spared:</p>

<p>"In this ballad the reader will find traces
of a singular superstition, not yet altogether
discredited in the wilder parts of Scotland.
The lykewake, or watching a dead body, in
itself a melancholy office, is rendered, in the
idea of the assistants, more dismally awful by
the mysterious horrors of superstition. In the
interval betwixt death and interment, the disembodied
spirit is supposed to hover round its
mortal habitation, and, if invoked by certain
rites, retains the power of communicating,
through its organs, the cause of its dissolution.
Such inquiries, however, are always
dangerous, and never to be resorted to unless
the deceased is suspected to have suffered <i>foul
play</i>, as it is called. It is the more unsafe to
tamper with this charm in an unauthorized
manner, because the inhabitants of the infernal
regions are, at such periods, peculiarly
active. One of the most potent ceremonies in
the charm, for causing the dead body to speak,
is setting the door ajar, or half open. On this
account the peasants of Scotland sedulously
avoid leaving the door ajar while a corpse lies
in the house. The door must either be left
wide open or quite shut; but the first is always
preferred, on account of the exercise of
hospitality usual on such occasions. The attendants
must be likewise careful never to
leave the corpse for a moment alone, or, if it
is left alone, to avoid, with a degree of superstitious
horror, the first sight of it.</p>

<p>"The following story, which is frequently
related by the peasants of Scotland, will illustrate
the imaginary danger of leaving the door
ajar. In former times a man and his wife
lived in a solitary cottage on one of the extensive
Border fells. One day the husband died
suddenly, and his wife, who was equally afraid
of staying alone by the corpse, or leaving the
dead body by itself, repeatedly went to the
door, and looked anxiously over the lonely
moor for the sight of some person approaching.
In her confusion and alarm she accidentally
left the door ajar, when the corpse suddenly
started up and sat in the bed, frowning
and grinning at her frightfully. She sat alone,
crying bitterly, unable to avoid the fascination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-282" id="Pg_2-282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of the dead man's eye, and too much terrified
to break the sullen silence, till a Catholic
priest, passing over the wild, entered the cottage.
He first set the door quite open, then
put his little finger in his mouth, and said the
paternoster backwards; when the horrid look
of the corpse relaxed, it fell back on the bed,
and behaved itself as a dead man ought to do.</p>

<p>"The ballad is given from tradition. I
have been informed by a lady of the highest
literary eminence [Miss Joanna Baillie], that
she has heard a ballad on the same subject, in
which the scene was laid upon the banks of
the Clyde. The chorus was,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Bothwell banks bloom bonny,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the watching of the dead corpse was said
to have taken place in Bothwell church."</p>

<p>Prince Robert's mother poisons him because
he has married against her will. He
sends for his bride to come, but she is in time
only for the funeral. The mother will give
her nothing of her son's, not even the ring on
his finger, all that she asks for. The bride's
heart breaks before the mother's face.</p>

<p>There are other ballad-stories of a mother's

<p>Pinkerton inserted Herd's 'Cruel Knight,'
<b>A</b>, in his Select Scotish Ballads, I, 69, with
alterations and omissions. Motherwell enters
in his Note-Book, p. 6, that he had received
from Mrs Gentles, Paisley, 'The Young Johnstone,'
"different in some measure from the
copy in Finlay's Ballads." Of the version
printed in his Minstrelsy (<b>B a</b>), undoubtedly
that which was derived from Mrs Gentles,
he says, "for a few verbal emendations recourse
has been had to Mr Finlay's copy
(<b>B b</b>)." These versions should therefore not
have differed considerably, Finlay suppressed
"Young Johnstone's reason for being sae late
a coming in," "as well as a concluding stanza
of inferior merit;" in this rejection he was
not followed by Motherwell. Christie, I, 156,
gives <b>E</b> "with some alterations from the way
it was sung" by an old woman; petty variations,
such as one must think could not have
impressed themselves upon a memory unapt
to retain things of more importance.
'Young Johnstone' in Chambers's Twelve
Romantic Scottish Ballads, p. 19, is made up
mostly from <b>B a</b>, <b>B b</b>, <b>E</b>, like the copy in the
same editor's Scottish Ballads, p. 293, but
handles tradition very freely.</p>

<p><b>E</b> seems to be <b>A</b> altered, or imperfectly remembered,
with the addition of a few stanzas.
Motherwell remarks of his version, what is
true of all the others but <b>E</b>, that the ballad
throws no light on Young Johnstone's motive
for stabbing his lady. An explanation was afforded
by the reciter: "The barbarous act was
committed unwittingly, through Young Johnstone's
suddenly waking from sleep, and, in
that moment of confusion and alarm, unhappily
mistaking his mistress for one of his pursuers."
And this is the turn which is given
to the act in <b>E</b> 13:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ohon, alas, my lady gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To come sae hastilie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought it was my deadly foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ye had trysted into me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The apology may go for what it is worth.
Awake or waking, Young Johnstone's first instinct
is as duly to stab as a bull-dog's is to
bite.</p>

<p><b>A</b> was printed in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, II, 73, 1802, "chiefly" from Mrs
Brown's MS.; in fact, with not quite forty
petty alterations. Scott remarks that the ballad
has been popular in many parts of Scotland.
Christie, I, 172, had heard it sung by
an old Banffshire woman, who died in 1866,
at the age of nearly eighty, with very little difference
from Scott's copy.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>The resemblance of the verse in <b>A</b> 31, 'The
boy stared wild like a gray gose-hawke,' to one
in 'Hardyknute,' 'Norse een like gray goss-hawk
stared wild,' struck Sir Walter Scott as
suspicious, and led him "to make the strictest
inquiry into the authenticity of the song. But
every doubt was removed by the evidence of
a lady of high rank [Lady Douglas of Douglas,
sister to Henry, Duke of Buccleuch, as we
are informed in the edition of 1833], who not
only recollected the ballad as having amused
her infancy, but could repeat many of the
verses." It is quite possible that Mrs Brown
may unconsciously have adopted this verse
from the tiresome and affected Hardyknute,
so much esteemed in her day. One would be
only too glad were this the only corruption
which the ballad had undergone. On the contrary,
while not calling in question the substantial
genuineness of the ballad, we must
admit that the form in which we have received
it is an enfeebled one, without much flavor or
color; and some such feeling no doubt affected
Sir Walter's mind, more than the reminiscence
of 'Hardyknute,' which, of itself, is of slight
account.</p>

<p>A tale 'How the king of Estmure Land married
the king's daughter of Westmure Land' is
mentioned in "The Complaint of Scotland,"
and there has been considerable speculation
as to what this tale might be, and also as to
what localities Estmure Land and Westmure
Land might signify. Seeing no clue to a settlement
of these questions, I pass them by,
with the simple comment that no king of Estmure
Land marries the king of Westmure
Land's daughter in this ballad or any other.</p>

<p>Three kings (King Easter and King Wester,
<b>A</b>, the Eastmure king and the Westmure
king, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and King Honor, <b>A</b>, the king of
Onorie, <b>B</b>, King Luve, <b>C</b>), court a lady, and
the third, who woos for womanhood and
beauty, <b>B</b>, wins her. The Eastmure king, <b>B</b>,
the Westmure, <b>C</b>, kills his successful rival on
his wedding-day. According to the prosaic,
not at all ballad-like, and evidently corrupted
account in <b>A</b>, there is a rebellion of nobles
four months after the marriage, and a certain
False Foodrage takes it upon himself to kill
the king. The murderer spares the queen,
and if she gives birth to a girl will spare her
child also, but if she bears a boy the boy is to
die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-297" id="Pg_2-297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>In <b>A</b> the queen escapes from custody before
her time comes, and gives birth to a boy in
the swines' sty. Lots are cast to see who
shall go find the queen (the narrative is very
vague here), and the lot falls on Wise William,
who sends his wife in his stead. The
queen induces this woman to exchange children
with her, Wise William's wife having a girl.
After some years Wise William reveals to the
boy that he is rightful lord of the castle (and
we may suppose royal dignity) which False
Foodrage has usurped. The boy kills False
Foodrage and marries Wise William's daughter.
Some of these incidents are wanting in
<b>B</b>. For Wise William's wife we have simply
a poor woman in the town.</p>

<p>'Fause Foodrage' is closely related to a
Scandinavian ballad, especially popular in Denmark,
where it is found in not less than twenty-three
manuscripts:</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> <b>A</b>, 'Ung Villum,' Danske Viser,
No 126, III, 135, 66 stanzas; <b>B</b>, 'Vold og
Mord,' Levninger, II, 64, No 12, 64 stanzas;
<b>C</b>, 'Lille Villum,' Kristensen, I, 305, No 111,
15 stanzas; also, Tragica, No 18, not seen.
<b>Icelandic.</b> 'KvÃ¦Ã°i af Loga Ã­ VallarhlÃ­Ã°,'
Ãslenzk fornkvÃ¦Ã°i, I, 235, No 28, 55 stanzas.
<b>Swedish.</b> 'Helleman Unge,' Arwidsson, I,
132, No 15, 13 stanzas (imperfect). <b>FÃ¤rÃ¶e</b>,
in unprinted copies. There are more incidents
in the Danish ballad, and too many, but
something, without doubt, has been lost from
the English, which, however, preserves these
essential points: A man that has wedded a
woman who had another lover is killed by his
competitor shortly after his marriage; a boy
is born, who is passed off as a girl; this boy,
before he has attained manhood, slays his father's
murderer.</p>

<p>In the Danish 'Young William,' <b>A</b>, Svend
of VoldeslÃ¸v, rich in gold, woos Lisbet, who
prefers William for his good qualities. Svend
shuts himself up in his room, sick with grief.
His mother and sister come and go. The
mother will get him a fairer maid, and gives
him the good rede not to distress himself about
a girl that is plighted to another man. The
sister gives a bad rede, to kill William, and
so get the bride. The mother remarks that a
son is coming into being who would revenge
his father's death. The business can be done,
says Svend, before that son is born, and immediately
after takes occasion to meet William
as he is passing through a wood, and kills
him. Forty weeks gone, Lisbet gives birth to
a son, but Svend is told that she has borne a
daughter. Young William attains to the age
of eighteen, and is a stalwart youth, given to
games of strength. One day when he is putting
the stone with a peasant, the two fall out,
and the peasant, being roughly treated, calls
out, You had better avenge your father's death.
Young William hastens to his mother, and
asks whether his father's death had been by
violence, and, if so, who killed him. The
mother thinks him too young to wield a sword:
he must summon Svend to a court. This is
done. Svend informs his uncle that he is
summoned to court by William, and asks what
he is to do. The uncle had always been told
that Lisbet's child was a girl. I shall never
live to see the day, says Svend, when I shall
beat a woman at tricks. Svend goes to the
court, attended by many of his uncle's men.
William charges him with the murder of his
father, for which no compensation has been
offered. Svend says not a penny will be paid,
and William draws his sword and cuts him
down. For killing Svend William is summoned
to court by Svend's brother, Nilus.
Nilus demands amends. William says they
are quit, with brother against father, and he
will marry Nilus's sister (whom he has already
carried off). Never, says Nilus, for which William
finds it necessary to kill <i>him</i>. He then
rides to his mother, who asks what amends
have been offered for his father's death, and,
on hearing that William has killed both the
murderer and his brother, clasps him to her
heart, for all her grief is now over.</p>

<p>No other Scandinavian copy besides Danish
<b>A</b> has the killing of Nilus, which may be regarded
as an aftergrowth. In the Icelandic
version, the sister, so far from putting her
brother up to the murder, bursts into tears
when her brother tells what he has done, because
she knows that revenge will follow. The
murderer offers himself to his former love in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-298" id="Pg_2-298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
place of her husband, at the very moment when
she is bowed in anguish over the dead body.
She replies significantly, He is not far from
me that shall revenge him. All the Scandinavian
copies have the three chief points of
the story except the Swedish, which lacks the
first half.</p>

<p>Another Scandinavian ballad has many of
the features of 'Young William:' <b>Danish</b>,
'Liden Engel,' <b>A</b>, Danske Viser, No 127, III,
147; <b>B</b>, Levninger, II, 82, No 13; <b>C</b>, Kristensen,
I, 254, No 97, a fragment. <b>Norwegian</b>,
'Unge Ingelbrett,' Bugge, p. 110, No 23, derived
from the Danish. According to Danish
<b>A</b>, and for the most part <b>B</b>, Liden Engel
(who, by the way, is of Westerris) carries
off a bride by force. Her brother burns
him and all his people in a church in which
they have taken refuge, the lady being saved
by lifting her on shields up to a window,
whence she is taken by her natural friends.
It is the mother that suggests the setting of
the church on fire, and the first act of the
daughter, after getting out of the church with
singed hair, is to fall on her bare knees and
pray that she may have a son who will take
vengeance on her brother. A son is born, and
called after his father, but his existence is as
far as possible kept secret. As he grows up
his mother is always saying to him, Thine
uncle was the death of thy father. The boy
wishes to serve the king; the mother says,
Go, but remember thy father's death. The
king observes that the youth has always a
weight on his mind, and on his asking the
cause Little Engel answers that his uncle had
slain his father and paid no boot. The king
says, If you wish to revenge his death, as it
is quite proper you should, I will lend you
three hundred men. When the uncle is informed
that Little Engel is coming against
him he declares that he had never heard of
such a person before: so the secret has been
well kept. Little Engel burns his uncle and
all his people in a stone chamber in which
they had shut themselves up.</p>

<p>In the Norwegian-Danish ballad Engel, or
Ingelbrett, the second simply kills his uncle
with a sword. The offence given in this case
is not the carrying off a bride by force, but the
omitting to ask the brother's consent to the
marriage, though that of all the rest of the
family had been obtained: another instance
of the danger of such neglect in addition to
those already mentioned in the preface to
'The Cruel Brother,' I, 142.</p>

JELLON GRAME.</h2>

Scott's Minstrelsy, II, 20, 1802.</p>

<p>'Jellon Grame' was first given to the
world in Scott's Minstrelsy, in 1802. The editor
says of this copy, <b>A b</b>, "This ballad is published
from tradition, with some conjectural
emendations. It is corrected by a copy in
Mrs Brown's MS. [<b>A a</b>], from which it differs
in the concluding stanzas. Some verses are apparently
modernized." The only very important
difference between Scott's version and
Mrs Brown's is its having four stanzas of its
own, the four before the last two, which are
evidently not simply modernized, but modern.</p>

<p>There is a material difference between the
story furnished by <b>A</b> and what we learn from
the three other copies. Jellon Grame sends
for his love Lillie Flower to come to the wood.
She is very eager to go, though warned by the
messenger that she may never come back.
Jellon Grame, who has already dug her grave,
kills her because her father will hang him
when it is discovered that she has had a child
by him. He brings up the child as his sister's
son. One day, when the boy asks why his
mother does not take him home, Jellon Grame
(very unnaturally) answers, I slew her, and
there she lies: upon which the boy sends an
arrow through him.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, the man is Henry, Hind Henry,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; the maid is May Margerie, <b>B</b>, May-a-Roe,
<b>C</b>, Margerie, <b>D</b>. Margerie, in <b>B</b>, receives
a message to come to the wood to make her
love a shirt, which surprises her, for no month
had passed in the year that she had not made
him three. Nevertheless, she goes, though
warned by her mother that there is a plot
against her life. She is stopped in the wood
by Hind Henry, who kills her because she
loves Brown Robin. Word is carried that
Margerie has been slain; her sister hastens to
the wood, takes under her care the child which
Margerie was going with, and calls him Brown
Robin, after his father. The lad goes to the
wood one day after school to pull a hollin
wand, and meets Hind Henry at the place
where the mother had been killed. No grass
is growing just there, and the boy asks Hind
Henry why this is so. Hind Henry, not less
frank than Jellon Grame, says, That is the
very spot where I killed your mother. The
boy catches at Henry's sword and runs him
through.</p>

<p><b>C</b> has nearly the same incidents as <b>B</b>, diluted
and vulgarized in almost twice as many
verses. Brown Robin is made to be Hind
Henry's brother. The sister does not appear
in the action, and the child is brought up by
the murderer, as in <b>A</b>, but is named Robin
Hood, after that bold robber. On hearing
from Hind Henry how his mother had come
to her death, young Robin sends an arrow to
his heart.</p>

<p>A story is supplied from the "traditions of
Galloway" for the fragmentary, and perhaps
heterogeneous, verses called <b>D</b>; I suppose by
Allan Cunningham. Margerie was beloved by
two brothers, and preferred the elder. Henry,
the younger, forged a billet to her by which
he obtained a meeting in a wood, when he reproached
her for not returning his feelings:
sts 1, 2. "She expostulated with him on the
impropriety of bringing her into an unfrequented
place for the purpose of winning affec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-303" id="Pg_2-303">[Pg 303]</a></span>tions
which, she observed, were not hers to bestow;"
but expostulations as to improprieties
producing but slight effect in "those rude
times," told him plainly that she was with child
by his brother. Henry drew his sword and
killed Margerie. The elder brother, who was
hunting, was apprised of mischief by the omens
in stanza 4. "Astonished at this singular
phenomenon, he immediately flew to the bower
of his mistress, where a page informed him she
was gone to the 'silver wood,' agreeably to
his desire. Thither he spurred his horse, and,
meeting Henry with his bloody sword still in
his hand, inquired what he had been killing."
The other replied as in stanza 5. "A mutual
explanation took place, and Henry fell by the
sword of his unhappy brother."</p>

<p>The resemblance of this ballad at the beginning
to '<a href="#Ballad_83">Child Maurice</a>' will not escape notice.
Silver Wood, or the silver wood, is
found in '<a href="#Ballad_83">Child Maurice</a>,' <b><a href="#Version_83_A">A</a></b> 1, <b><a href="#Version_83_G">G</a></b> 1. <b>A</b> 14, <b>B</b>
10, <b>C</b> 15, is a commonplace: see No 66, <b>A</b>
28, 29, <b>B</b> 20, 21, <b>D</b> 9, <b>E</b> 40; No 70, <b>B</b> 25;
No 81, <b>K</b> 13. <b>B</b> 13 is found in <a href="#Version_102_B">'Willie and
Earl Richard's Daughter,' <b>B</b></a> 24: cf. <b>A</b> 15. The
phenomenon in <b>D</b> 4 we have had in No 65, <b>D</b>
17.</p>

<p>'Jellon Grame,' and particularly versions <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, may be regarded as a counterpart to
'<a href="#Ballad_89">Fause Foodrage</a>,' and especially to versions
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, of that ballad. In 'Fause Foodrage,' <b><a href="#Version_89_B">B</a></b>,
<b><a href="#Version_89_C">C</a></b>, and 'Jellon Grame,' <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, a woman has
two lovers. The one who is preferred is killed
by the other in 'Fause Foodrage;' in 'Jellon
Grame' the woman herself is killed by the
lover she has rejected. This kind of interchange
is familiar in ballads. In both 'Fause
Foodrage' and 'Jellon Grame' the son of the
woman, before he comes to manhood, takes
vengeance on the murderer.</p>

<p>'Jellon Grame,' as well as 'Fause Foodrage,'
has certainly suffered very much in
transmission. It is interesting to find an ancient
and original trait preserved even in so
extremely corrupted a version as <b>C</b> of the present
ballad, a circumstance very far from unexampled.
In stanza 18 we read that the child
who is to avenge his mother "grew as big in ae
year auld as some boys woud in three," and we
have a faint trace of the same extraordinary
thriving in <b>B</b> 15: "Of all the youths was at
that school none could with him compare."
So in one of the Scandinavian ballads akin to
'Fause Foodrage,' and more remotely to 'Jellon
Grame,' the corresponding child grows
more in two months than other boys in eight
years:</p>

<p>This is a commonplace: so again Bugge, No

and Sir Gowther.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b> 14 we are told that the boy was called
by his father's name (<b>C</b> 17 is corrupted).
This is a point in the corresponding Scandinavian

in The Northumberland Garland, 1793, p. 38
of the reprint of Northern Garlands, 1809.
Ritson's copy is repeated in Bell's Rhymes of
Northern Bards, 1812, p. 147, and in Richardson's
Borderer's Table Book, VI, 141.</p>

<p>The story is very well preserved and very
well told in <b>A</b>. All the seven sisters of a
family are destined to die of their first child.
Five having so died already, one of the remaining
two expresses a resolution never to
marry, since she is sure that she will go the
way of the others. She is told that a knight
has been there, asking for her hand. Then in
three quarters of a year they may come to her
burial. When her husband's mother welcomes
her to her castle and bowers, the bride responds,
under the operation of her melancholy
conviction, I think they 'll soon be yours.
At the end of three quarters of a year she
sends messages to her family: to her mother
to come to her sickening or her wake;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> to her
sister to remain in maidenhood, and escape the
doom of the family. When the mother arrives
the young wife is in extremities.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> She
gives rings to her mother, who is all to blame,
gives rings to her husband, and with a razor
opens her side, and takes out an heir for the
house. In <b>D</b> we are told that five boys had
been cut from their mothers, Mary's sisters,
before. In <b>B</b> the remaining sister declares
that no man shall ever lie by her side; but her
mother says she shall marry though she live
but three quarters of a year: so, nearly, in
<b>C</b>.</p>

<p>A Breton ballad, 'Pontplancoat,' <b>A</b>, Luzel,
I, 382, <b>B</b>, p. 386, exhibits such correspondences
with the English and Scottish that we cannot
hesitate to assume that it has the same source.</p>

<p>In the first version Pontplancoat marries
Marguerite for his third wife. He is obliged
by affairs to leave her, and has a dream which
disturbs him so much that he returns home
the same night. This dream is that his wife
has been three days in travail, and it proves
true. A spoon is put in the lady's mouth, an
incision made in her right side, and a son
taken out. This is Pontplancoat's third son,
and each of them has been extracted from his
mother's side. He has had three wives of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-310" id="Pg_2-310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
name of Marguerite, and they have all died in
this way.</p>

<p>Marguerite, in the other version, is told by
her mother that she is to marry Pontplancoat.
Marguerite signifies her obedience, but Pontplancoat
has already had four wives of her
name, all of whom "had been opened," and
she shall be the fifth. As before, Pontplancoat
is obliged to go away, and during his absence
he receives letters which inform him that
his wife is in labor and that the chances are
against a normal delivery. He returns instantly.
The lady has been three days in labor.
A silver ball is put into her mouth, her right
side opened with a knife, and a son extracted.
Pontplancoat has four sons besides, all of whom
have been brought into the world in this way.</p>

<p>English <b>A</b> is localized in Northumberland,
and Mary made the wife of a Sir William
Fenwick of Wellington. According to notes
of Percy, he had not been able to find a Sir
William Fenwick, lord of Wallington, with a
wife of the name of Mary. Were a Sir William
and Lady Mary Fenwick authenticable,
a nice historical question would arise between
them and some baron and baroness of the
family Pontplancoat in FinistÃ¨re, Brittany.</p>

<p>An extensively disseminated Scandinavian
ballad has been assumed to be of kin with
'Mary of Wallington,' and in one version or
another has resemblances which may possibly
come from unity of origin, but the general
likeness is certainly not striking. The published
texts are: <b>Norwegian</b>, 'MaalfrÃ­,' Bugge,
Gamle norske Folkeviser, p. 122, No 25,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. <b>Icelandic</b>, 'MÃ¡lfrÃ­Ã°ar kvÃ¦Ã°i,' Ãslenzk
fornkvÃ¦Ã°i, I, 208, No 24, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>. <b>Swedish</b>,
'Herr Peder och Malfred,' Afzelius, I, 70, No
14. <b>Danish</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Esben og Malfred,' "Tragica,
No 26," Danske Viser, III, 208, No 133; <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, Kristensen, I, 232, No 87, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
'Malfreds DÃ¸d,' Kristensen, II, 232, No 69,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; <b>F</b>, 'Liden Malfreds Vise,' Feilberg,
Fra Heden, p. 119; <b>G</b>, 'Herr Peder og Liden
Malfred,' Berggreen's Danske Folkesange, 3d
ed., p. 172, No 88. The Danish ballad is
preserved in ten manuscripts, and Grundtvig
possessed not less than twenty-two traditionary
Danish versions and two Swedish, which
he did not live to print.</p>

<p>The Norwegian ballad is most like, or least
unlike, the English. MaalfrÃ­, a king's only
daughter, is married to Karl, king of England.
It was spaed to her when she was yet a maid
that she should die of her twelfth lying in; she
has already born eleven children. The king
purposing to leave her for a time, she reminds
him of the prophecy. He defies spaewives
and goes, but after three days dreams that
MaalfrÃ­'s cloak is cut in two, that her hair is
cut to bits, etc.; and this sends him home,
when he learns that two sons have been cut
from her side. He throws himself on his
sword. MaalfrÃ­, Malfred, is, in the other Norse
ballads, also an only daughter, and dies in her
twelfth child-birth, in all but Icelandic <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, where the first is fatal to her. There are
no other important diversities, and the resemblances
in the details of the Norse and the
English ballads are these two: the wife being
fated to die of her first child in Icelandic
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, and the CÃ¦sarean operation in the
Norwegian versions.</p>

<p>It is barely worth mentioning that there is
also a German ballad, in which a maid (only
eleven years old in most of the versions) begs
her mother not to give her to a husband, because
she will not live more than a year if
married, and dies accordingly in child-birth:
'Hans Markgraf,' "Bothe, FrÃ¼hlings-Almanach,
1806, p. 132," reprinted in BÃ¼sching und
von der Hagen's Volkslieder, p. 30, Erlach, II,
136, Mittler, No 133; "Alle bei Gott die sich
lieben," Wunderhorn, 1808, II, 250, Erlach,
IV, 127, Mittler, No 128; Hoffmann und
Richter, Schlesische Volkslieder, p. 12, No 5,
Mittler, No 132. To these may be added 'Der
Graf und die Bauerntochter,' Ditfurth, II, 8,
No 9; 'Der Mutter Fluch,' Meinert, p. 246.
In these last it is the mother who objects to
the marriage, on account of her daughter's
extreme youth.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_149_149" id="Footnote_149_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_149_149"><span class="label">[149]</span></a> There are six double stanzas in Johnson's Museum, p.
118, to which Stenhouse, IV, 115, adds a concluding one,
the fourth of Herd's. "This ballad," Stenhouse was informed,
"was composed about the beginning of the last century
by a young widow in Galloway, whose husband was
drowned on a voyage to Holland." His authority was probably
traditional, and all the information except the date, and,
to be accurate, the widowhood, is found in the song itself.
Motherwell, Minstrelsy, Introduction, p. lxxii, note 37, observes
that neither Herd's nor Johnson's copy is so full "as
one which may occasionally be met with in stall editions published
about sixty years ago:" 1827. Logan, who prints two
vulgar versions, or rather perversions, in which a bridegroom
is pressed into the king's sea-service on the night of his marriage,
Pedlar's Pack, p. 22, says: "A more lengthened version
of the same ballad in the Scotch dialect will be found in
Book First of A Selection of Scots Songs, Harmonised....
By Peter Urbani, Professor of Music, Edinburgh, circa
1794." Christie, I, 236, says that 'The Lowlands of Holland'
was sung in his father's family, in Aberdeenshire, as
far back as the middle of the last century. Herd's copy is
translated by Talvj, Charakeristik, p. 594.</p></div></div>

<p>'Lammikin: an Old Scotch Ballad,' Aberdeen,

be edited by the Rev. Dr John Burnett Pratt,
Episcopal minister at Cruden, Aberdeenshire,
is made up of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, with such alterations
as seemed good to the editor, and a few
interpolated stanzas.</p>

York, 1846 (Notes and Queries, Fourth Series,

built a castle for a nobleman, cannot get his
pay, and therefore seeks revenge. The name
given the builder is Lamkin, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>,

<b>F b</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>; Lantin, <b>T</b>; Long Lankyn, or
Long Longkin, <b>F a</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>K</b>; Rankin, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>; Balankin,
or Lambert Linkin, <b>B</b>; Balcanqual, <b>R</b>.
That of the nobleman is Lord Wearie, Weire,
<b>A</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>U b</b>; Lord Earie, <b>N</b>; Erley, Earley,
<b>J</b>; Murray, <b>I</b>; Arran, <b>C</b>; Montgomery, <b>E</b>;
Cassilis, <b>S</b>; he is lord of Prime Castle, <b>B</b>. The
lord, having occasion to leave his family, fears
mischief from the man whom he has wronged,
and enjoins his wife to keep the castle well
fastened. Precautions are taken, but nevertheless
his enemy effects an entrance through
some aperture that has not been secured, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-321" id="Pg_2-321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>U b</b>, or by connivance with
a nurse, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>. Most of the servants
are away. To get at the lady, Lamkin, as we
may call him, by advice of the nurse inflicts
some hurt on the babe in the cradle, stabbing
it, or "nipping" it, and its cries bring the
mother down. The lady proffers large sums
of gold to save her life, but Lamkin does not
care for gold now. He gloats over his opportunity,
and bids the nurse, or a maid-servant,
or even one of the daughters of the house, to
scour a silver bason to hold the lady's noble
blood. The lord has a presentiment of calamity
at home, and, returning, finds his house red
with the blood of his wife and child. Lamkin
is hanged, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, or burned, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, or boiled
in a pot full of lead, <b>D</b>. The nurse is burned,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, or hanged, <b>C</b>, <b>Q</b>, or boiled in a
caldron, <b>I</b>.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>In <b>K</b>, the oldest version, except perhaps <b>P</b>,
which is greatly inferior, Lady Betty is called
down by Longkin to see her mother's blood
running, then Lady Nelly to see her sister's
blood running, Lady Jenny to see Lady Nelly's,
etc. In <b>F</b>, <b>T</b>, the mother, very unnaturally,
offers Lamkin her daughter as wife, in
ransom of her own life. In <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, a servant
offers her life for her lady; in <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>K</b>, a
daughter for her mother.</p>

<p>Motherwell remarks, p. lxx of his Minstrelsy,
note 27: "There is a 'Lambirkyns wod'
near Dupplin, in Perthshire. Can this have
got its name from the cruel mason who the
ballad assures us 'lived in the wode'? If so,
it must be very ancient. It is localized, too,
I believe, at Balwearie, in Fifeshire; but there
are few places where the ballad is remembered
but which have also some ancient edifice in the
neighborhood reared by the hands of Lammikin.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Indeed, it seems questionable how some
Scottish lairds could well afford to get themselves
seated in the large castles they once occupied
unless they occasionally treated the
mason after the fashion adopted in this ballad."
And again, at p. 291: "There can be
little doubt that the epithet Linkin Mr Lambert
acquired from the secrecy and address
with which he insinuated him into that notable
strength [Prime Castle]. Indeed, all the
names of Lammerlinkin, Lammikin, Lamkin,
Lankin, Linkin, Belinkin, can easily be traced
out as abbreviations of Lambert Linkin." It
might be inferred, however, from the mason's
seemingly resentful inquiry in <b>A</b> 8-11, <b>J</b> 3-6,
Where's the men, women, bairns, lady, that
call me Lamkin? that the view in these particular
versions was that Lamkin was a sobriquet
applied in derision of the meekness with which
the builder had submitted to his injury. Linkin,
it will be observed, occurs only in <b>B</b>, and
it is far more likely that Lamkin, or Lammikin,
which is found in a full dozen copies, is
a simply ironical designation for the bloody
mason, the terror of countless nurseries.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

YOUNG WATERS</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Percy's Reliques, 1765, II, 172.</p></div>


<p>Percy took this ballad "from a copy
printed not long since at Glasgow, in one
sheet 8vo," and he informs us that the world
was indebted for its publication to the Lady
Jean Hume, sister to the Earl of Hume.
Maidment, Scotish Ballads and Songs, Historical
and Traditionary, II, 62, gives the title
of the first edition as follows: Young
Waters, an Ancient Scotish Poem, never before
printed. Glasgow: printed and sold by
Robert and Andrew Foulis. <span class="smcap">MDCCLV.</span> Small
4to, pp. 8. He does not say whether he
prints from the original edition. The ballad
was repeated in Herd's Ancient and Modern
Scots Songs, 1769, p. 238; in Ritson's Scotish
Song, 1794, II, 181, with the variation of
a word or two; and in Pinkerton's Select
Scotish Ballads, 1783, I, 72, with arbitrary
changes.</p>

<p>Motherwell, Minstrelsy, Introduction, p.
lxviii, note 16, says he had never met with
any traditionary version of this ballad. There
is a copy in the Skene MSS, p. 23, which
in all likelihood was learned by the writer
from print. Buchan, who may generally be
relied upon to produce a longer ballad than
anybody else, has 'Young Waters' in thirty-nine
stanzas, "the only complete version which
he had ever met." Of this copy I will only say
that everything which is not in the edition of
1755 (itself a little the worse for editing) is a
counterfeit of the lowest description. Nevertheless
it is given in an appendix; for much
the same reason that thieves are photographed.</p>

<p>It is possible, and Aytoun, I, 93, thinks
highly probable, that this ballad may have
been founded on some real event in Scottish
history; but Aytoun shows a commendable
discretion in his conclusion that, "though various
conjectures have been hazarded as to its
origin, none appear sufficiently plausible to
warrant their adoption," an opinion in which
Maidment fully concurs. Chambers, who unhesitatingly
accepted Buchan's ballad, did not,
in 1829, entertain the least doubt that Young
Waters was one of the Scottish nobles executed
by James I after his return from his
captivity in England, and very probably Walter
Stuart, second son of the Duke of Albany:
The Scottish Ballads, p. 34. Thirty years
later he had no more doubt that the ballad
was composed by Lady Wardlaw.</p>

<p>A Scandinavian ballad, historical to the extent
that one version has historical names,
exhibits the principal incidents of the short
story of 'Young Waters.' <b>Danish.</b> 'Folke
LovmandsÃ¸n og Dronning Helvig,' texts of the

Grundtvig, III, 697. The king and queen, Danish
<b>B</b>, are Magnus I of Sweden and his wife Helvig
(died 1290, 1325). Folke LovmandsÃ¸n is
in high favor with dames and maids, but especially
with the queen, to whose service he is devoted.
A little wee page plays the part of the
wily lord of 'Young Waters' in exciting the
king's jealousy. The innocent young knight is
rolled down hill in a tun set with knives.</p>

<p><b>D</b>, <b>E</b> form the conclusion of a ballad which
belongs to the series of 'Mary Hamilton,' or
'The Queen's Mary,' and give an entirely
wrong turn to that distressful tragedy.</p>

<p><b>F</b> had become a children's game, the last
stage of many old ballads: see the notes. In
<b>G</b> and <b>H</b> the verses are set in a popular tale,
and a characteristic explanation is furnished
of the danger which the heroine has incurred:
she has lost a golden key, or a golden ball,
which had been entrusted to her. See, again,
the notes.</p>

<p>All the English versions are defective and
distorted, as comparison will show. In many
others, both from northern and southern Europe,
a young woman has fallen into the hands
of corsairs; father, mother, brother, sister, refuse
to pay ransom, but her lover, in one case
husband, stickles at no price which may be
necessary to retrieve her.</p>

<p>We will begin with the best ballad of the
cycle, the <b>Sicilian</b> 'Scibilia Nobili,' communicated
to Nuove Effemeridi Siciliane, Nuova
Serie, I, 528, 1874, by Salvatore Struppa, as
sung by a peasant woman in the neighborhood
of Marsala, 151 verses.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Tunisian corsairs,
learning of the marriage of the king's
daughter, fit out a strong force, and when they
are near port change caps, to pass for Christians.
They knock at Scibilia's door, and, on
her refusing to open, her husband being
a-hunting, burst the door in, and carry her on
board ship. Her husband goes to the shore
weeping, and offers her captors her weight in
gold; they will not give her up for a shipful.
He begs to be allowed a word with her: why
has she let herself be carried off, and who will
nurse her boy? She refuses to eat, drink, or
sleep. The sailors fall asleep, and Scibilia
drops into the sea. They take silk ladders to
recover her; she weeps always. (It would be
superfluous to do more than point to the fact
that the story is not well compacted, or altogether
rational, as we have it.) The lady,
turning to a sailor, says, Can you tell me
how the wind is? If north or south, I will
go to my father. No opposition is made by
the pirates, who had but just now refused a
shipful of gold for her. "My dear father,
will you ransom me?" "For how much, my
dear daughter?" "Three lions, three falcons,
and four pillars of gold." "I cannot lose so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-347" id="Pg_2-347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
much money: how much better lose you!"
She is urged by her captors to eat and drink,
but will not eat, drink, or sleep, for her boy
is starving. She again makes for the coast,
weeping ever, and the foregoing scene, from
the inquiry as to the wind, is repeated with
mother, brother, sister. All say it is better
to lose her than so much money. She finally
tries her husband, who answers, Better lose
all this gold; it is enough if you are not lost.
And after three days the father died. "And
let him die; I will dress all in red." And
after three days the mother died. "And let
her die; I will dress all in yellow." And
after three days the brother died. "And let
him die; I will dress all in green." And
after three days the sister died. "And let
her die; I will dress all in white. And if
my dear husband dies, I will dress in black."</p>

<p><b>Spanish.</b> <b>A. a</b>, 'La Donzella,' Die Balearen
in Wort und Bild geschildert, II, 263
(privately printed by the Archduke Ludwig
Salvator, Leipzig, 1871, a book which I have
not been able to obtain), Liebrecht, Zur
Volkskunde, p. 231; <b>b</b>, Briz, Cansons de la
Terra, IV, 15, from a Majorcan <i>revista</i>. <b>B.</b>
'Lo Rescat,' Briz, IV, 13. <b>C.</b> 'La Cautiva,'
MilÃ¡, Romancerillo, p. 257, No 261. In <b>A</b> a
maid, who is embroidering a handkerchief by
the seashore, lacking silk, hails a vessel, and
asks if they have any. She is invited to come
aboard and see if they have what she requires.
She falls asleep, and the sailors put off. This
beginning is like that of another very common
ballad. The maid is wakened by the singing
of the sailors, and asks them to put into the
port where her father is. What follows corresponds
to the English ballad. "Father, will
you ransom me? The Moors offer me for
sale." "Dear daughter, how much do they
ask?" "I am yours for a hundred crowns."
"Daughter, I will not pay a penny for you."
The scene is repeated with mother, brother,
and sister, all of whom make the same answer
as the father, and then with the lover; but his
reply is, I would not give you up for all the
world.</p>

<p>The first five stanzas of <b>A</b> are wanting in <b>B</b>,
which begins, accordingly, at the point where
the maid asks to have the ship put about. The
sister is omitted in <b>B</b>, as also in <b>A b</b>. <b>C</b> is
shortened still further, beginning with the appeal
to the father, and omitting both sister
and brother.</p>

<p><b>FÃ¤rÃ¶e.</b> 'FrÃ­sa VÃ­sa,' communicated by
Hammershaimb, with other ballads, to the
Antiquarisk Tidsskrift, 1849-51, p. 95. Frisian
pirates are carrying away a maid. She
weeps and beats her hands, and cries, Wait,
my father will ransom me; he will ransom me
with his castles; he will not let me perish in
Friesland. The father answers, I have only
two castles; neither of them can I give up for
thee; indeed thou mayst perish in Friesland.
The Frisians are starting off again. The maid
begs them to stop; her mother will redeem
her with her kirtles. But the mother says, I
have but two kirtles, and neither of them can
I give up for thee; indeed thou mayst perish
in Friesland. Once more the Frisians are
about to put off. The maid says her lover
will redeem her with his ships. The lover
loyally responds, I have only two ships; both
will I gladly part with for thee; thou shalt
not perish in Friesland. It appears from a
note of Hammershaimb that the ballad might
be extended indefinitely by the maid's calling
upon brother, sister, and friends to redeem her
with their respective valuables.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><b>Icelandic.</b> A ballad briefly mentioned at
p. 20 f of the volume of the Antiquarisk Tidsskrift,
before cited. The Frisians call out,
Bear the Danish maid to the ships! 'Bide,
Frisians, bide; my kinsfolk will redeem me.'
Upon the sixth appeal, to her lover, the maid
is ransomed.</p>

<p><b>Swedish.</b> 'Den BortsÃ¥lda,' the same ballad
as the FÃ¤rÃ¶e and the Icelandic, with an
absurd introductory stanza, in which the maid
is said to have been sold into the heathen
land by her parents for a bit of bread; whence
the title. <b>A. a</b>, Afzelius, No 15, I, 73;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>

p. 174, No 2, three stanzas, the rest
said to be "entirely like" the Afzelius copies,
which differ considerably. A maid is in the
hands of sea-rovers, and they are on the point
of rowing off with her. She wrings her hands,
and calls to them to wait a while. She sees
her father coming, who will redeem her with
his oxen, and so she shall escape going to the
heathen land to pine away. The father says
he has but oxen two: the one he shall be using,
the other he shall keep&mdash;lÃ¥ta stÃ¥; and she will
not scape going to the heathen land. The
sailors lower their oars. The maid wrings her
hands, and calls to them again to wait; she
sees her mother coming, who will redeem her
with her gold caskets. The mother says she
has of gold caskets but two: the one she shall
be using, the other shall let stay. The maid
sees her sister, who will redeem her with her
gold crowns. The sister has but two gold
crowns, one of which she shall be using, the
other will let be. The maid sees her brother,
who will redeem her with his foals. The
brother has but two foals: the one he shall be
using, the other he will let be, and she will not
scape from going to the heathen land to pine
away. Then the maid sees her true-love coming,
and calls to him to redeem her with his
gold rings. "Of gold rings," he says, "I
have no more than twelve: with six I shall
redeem thee, six thou shalt have thyself; so
thou scapest going to the heathen land to pine
away."</p>

<p>This is the story in <b>A</b>, and the chief variations
of the other copies are in the things
which the maid proposes to her kindred and
her lover to redeem her with, and the number
of these which they profess to have. The
spuriousness of the introductory stanza, in
which the girl is said to have been sold into
the heathen land for dire need, is evident.
The family have two oxen, two gold caskets,
two gold crowns, two foals; or even houses,
gold caskets, gold chains, mills, more than five,
<b>B</b>, and no doubt everything handsome about
them. In <b>D</b> the father is even a king. <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>
lack this beginning. <b>C</b> concludes with a permissible
imprecation on the part of the
lover:</p>

'Die Losgekaufte,' in Kretzschmer, I, 181, is
rewritten; 'Loskauf,' in Simrock, No 39, p. 90,
is made up from a variety of copies. Several
of the versions come very near to one another,
especially <b>C-F</b>, nor is there any noteworthy
difference in the story of the whole series, save
a single point in the last three. A maid whom
seamen are carrying off begs them to stop
or put back to land; she has a father who will
not abandon her. She begs her father to part
with coat, house, hat, watch, or bull, to save
her from drowning; the father refuses. Then,
as before, she successively and vainly entreats
her mother to redeem her with gold chain,
ring, apron, gown, or silver trinkets; her
brother with silver buckles, hat, horse, sword,
or coat; her sister with apron, dress, shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-349" id="Pg_2-349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
green wreath, or pearl wreath. Two of the
four relatives are wanting in <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>. All of
her blood refusing to ransom the maid, she
calls upon her lover to sacrifice sword, horse,
ring, golden hill, to save her, or, in <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, to
sell himself to the oar, and the lover is ready
in every case. The redemption is not from
slavery in a foreign land, but from drowning.</p>

<p><b>Esthonian.</b> The ballad is known all over
Esthonia, and a copy composed of two closely
resembling versions is given by Neus, Ehstnische
Volkslieder, p. 109, 'Die AusgelÃ¶ste.'
A girl, taken captive in war, asks that the
boats may put in, in order that she may find
some one to buy her off. She appeals first to
her mother, who might redeem her with the
best of three aprons which she possesses, one
of which is of gold web, another of silver, another
of brass. A daughter, answers the
mother, is a thing of to-day and to-morrow;
my aprons are for life. Her father is next
asked to ransom her with the best of three
bulls which he owns, which have a horn of
gold, silver, and brass respectively. His
daughter is his for two days, his bulls for life.
The brother is entreated to save her by the
sacrifice of the best of his three horses, which
have severally manes of gold, silver, and brass.
His sister is his for two days, his horse for
life. The sister is asked to part with the
best of her three wreaths, which are of gold,
silver, brass, for an only sister's sake. A
sister is hers for a month or two, her wreath
for life. Finally the maid turns to her true-love,
who has three hats, one of brass, one
of silver, one of gold, and entreats him to
devote the best to her redemption. How long
lasts a hat? he exclaims. A couple of days;
but my betrothed for life! Another copy of
the same ballad is given by Neus in Dorpater
JahrbÃ¼cher, V, 228.</p>

<p>The ballad is equally popular in Finland:
'Lunastettava neiti,' Kanteletar, 1864, p. 283,
No 26, p. 285, No 27, ed. 1840, III, 131, 137,
273 f; Rancken, NÃ¥gra prof, p. 9.</p>

<p>In various Slavic ballads the man and maid
change parts, and the man is ransomed by the
generosity of his mistress when his kinsfolk
have failed him.</p>

<p>Two <b>Wendish</b> ballads, Haupt and Schmaler,
<b>A</b>, No 74, <b>B</b>, No 75, I, 107 ff, begin, like
the popular German ballad 'Der SchÃ¤fer und
der Edelmann,' with a shepherd's being thrown
into prison by a nobleman for wearing a costume
beyond his rank, and proud words besides.
He sees his father coming, <b>A</b>, and asks
him to pawn half a hundred sheep and get
him out. The father prefers his half hundred
sheep. He sees his mother coming, and asks
her to pawn two cows and release him. She
prefers her cows. He sees his brother coming,
and asks him to pawn his horse. His brother
prefers his horse. He sees his sister coming,
and asks her to pawn a fine gown, but the
gown again is much dearer in his sister's eyes.
He sees his love coming, and asks her to pawn
her coral necklace for his ransom, which she
does, and he is released. In <b>B</b> he writes to
father, mother, and sister to ransom him; they
all tell him that if he were good for anything
he would not be in prison. His love flies to
him and ransoms him.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p><b>Russian.</b> &#268;elakowskÃ½, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 106,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Sakharof,
IV, 171, No 13. A young man in prison
writes to father and mother for ransom; the
whole family will have nothing to do with
malefactors and robbers. His love, when written
to, calls to her women to get her gold together,
all that shall be needed to free him.</p>

<p><b>Little-Russian.</b> Golovatsky, I, 48, No 8.
An imprisoned youth writes to his father,
Wilt thou ransom me, or shall I perish? How
much must he give? Forty saddled horses.
Better he should perish. He writes to his
mother; she must give forty oxen with their
yokes. She declines. He writes to his love;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-350" id="Pg_2-350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
she must furnish forty geese with their goslings.
I will spin, she says, spin lustily, buy
geese, and ransom thee. No 7, I, 46, is to the
same effect, but lacks the close.</p>

<p><b>Slovenian.</b> 'Rodbina,' 'Kinship,' Vraz,
Narodne P&#283;sni ilirske, p. 141.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> A hero in
prison asks his father to release him; the
three horses he must give are too much. He
asks his mother; the three castles she must
give are too much. He asks his brother; the
three rifles he must give are too much. He
asks his sister; the three fair tresses she must
sacrifice are too much. He asks his love; she
must give her white hand. Not too much is
my white hand, she says; easy to give for thee
hand and life besides.</p>

<p>A Little-Russian ballad in Waclaw z Oleska,
p. 226, and a Polish in WaldbrÃ¼hl's Balalaika,
p. 504, have the same theme, Love
stronger than Blood (woman's love here), but
do not belong with the pieces already cited as
to form.</p>

<p>The 'Gay Goshawk' first appeared in print
in the second volume of Scott's Minstrelsy, in
1802. Scott's copy was formed partly from Mrs
Brown's version, <b>A</b>, "and partly from a MS.
of some antiquity <i>penes Edit</i>." This compounded
copy is now given, <b>E</b>, with those portions
which are contained in the Brown MS.
printed in smaller type, in order that what is
peculiar to the other manuscript may be distinguished.
A second copy of <b>A</b> was made for
William Tytler under the direction of the
reciter in 1783, but has not been recovered.
There were 28 stanzas, as in <b>A</b>, and the first
stanza has been given by Anderson in Nichols's
Illustrations, VII, 176. <b>C</b> was furnished
Motherwell by Buchan from a manuscript sent
him, and Buchan says that he himself took
down from recitation the vilely dilated and
debased <b>G</b>: Ballads of the North of Scotland,
II, 340.</p>

<p>A ballad widely known in France has the
central idea of the Gay Goshawk, a maid's
feigning death to escape from a father to a
lover whom she is not permitted to marry, but
in the development of the story there is no
likeness. A version of this ballad, 'Belle
Isambourg,' was printed as early as 1607 in
a collection with the title Airs de Cour, p.
40, and was republished by Rathery in the
Moniteur of August 26, 1853, p. 946, afterwards
in Haupt's FranzÃ¶sische Volkslieder,
p. 92. The king wishes to give Fair Isam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-356" id="Pg_2-356">[Pg 356]</a></span>bourg
a husband, but her heart is fixed on a
handsome knight, whom she loves more than
all her kin together, though he is poor. The
king shuts her up in a dark tower, thinking
that this treatment will bring about a change,
but it does not. Isambourg sees her lover
riding towards or by the tower at full speed.
She calls to him to stop, and says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Malade et morte m'y feray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Porter en terre m'y lairray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pourtant morte je ne seray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Puis apres je vous prie amy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qu'Ã  ma chapelle a Sainct-Denis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne m'y laissez pas enfouir.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Isambourg is now proclaimed to be dead,
and is carried to burial by three princes and
a knight. Her lover, hearing the knelling and
chanting, puts himself in the way and bids the
bearers stop. Since she has died for loving
him too well, he wishes to say a De profundis.
He rips open a little of the shroud, and she
darts a loving smile at him. Everybody is
astonished.</p>

<p>Other versions, derived from oral tradition,
have a more popular stamp: (1.) PoÃ©sies
populaires de la France, MS., III, 54, 'La fille
du roi et le Prince de Guise,' learned at Maubeuge,
about 1760. (2.) III, 47, 'Le beau
DÃ©on,' Auvergne. (3.) III, 49, 'La princesse
de la Grand' Tour,' Berry. (4.) III, 50 (the
hero being LÃ©on), Berry. (5.) III, 53, Caudebec.

Auvergne. (14.) G. de Nerval, La BohÃ¨me
Galante, ed. 1866, p. 70, and Les Faux Saulniers,
ed. 1868, p. 346, the story completed in
Les Filles du Feu, ed. 1868, p. 132; or, in
the collection lately made from his works,
Chansons et Ballades p. du Valois, p. 16,
VIII. The last two have a false termination,
as already remarked under No 4, I, 42.</p>

<p>In these traditional versions, the father pays
a visit to the princess after she has been confined
seven years, and asks how she is. One
side is eaten away by worms, her feet are rotting
in the irons. She begs a few sous to give
the jailer to loosen her fetters. Millions are
at her disposal if she will give up her lover.
Rather rot, is her reply. Rot, then, says her
father. The lover comes by and throws a few
words of writing into the tower, directing her
to counterfeit death. The rest is much the
same. In several versions the king yields.</p>

<p>There are many other ballads in which a
girl, for one reason or another, feigns death.

la Garde,' etc., Arbaud, I, 143, Decombe, Ch.

Syster,' Arwidsson, I, 380 No 61; in a Bohemian

<p>In 'Willie's Lyke-Wake,' No 25, I, 247, a
man feigns death in order to capture a coy
maid, or a maid refused him by her parents.</p>

<p>Birds are not seldom employed as posts in
ballads: see 'Sweet William,' Motherwell's
Minstrelsy, p. 307, MilÃ¡, Romancerillo, No

A falcon carries a letter, in Afzelius, III, 116,
No 87, and MilÃ¡, No 258 K, and Marko Kraljevitch
sends a letter by a falcon from his
prison, Karadshitch, II, 383. For a love-message
of a general sort, not involving business,
the nightingale is usually and rightly selected.
On the other hand, a nightingale first orders
a ring of a goldsmith, and afterwards delivers
it to a lady, in Uhland, No 15.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> In this ballad
the goshawk is endowed with the nightingale's
voice. The substitution of a parrot in
<b>G</b>, a bird that we all know can talk, testifies
to the advances made by reason among the
humblest in the later generations.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> A parrot,
says Buchan, "is by far a more likely messenger
to carry a love-letter or deliver a verbal
message," II, 341. The parrot goes well with
the heroine swooning on a sofa (stanza 33)
and the step-dame sitting on the sofa's end
(stanza 36).</p>

<p>Thieves drop three drops of <i>wax</i> on the
breast of a servant-girl who is feigning sleep,
and she shows no sign of feeling, in a Catalan

BROWN ROBIN</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_97_A">A</a>.</b> 'Brown Robin.' <b>a.</b> Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 37.
<b>b.</b> Abbotsford MS., "Scottish Songs."</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_97_B">B</a>.</b> 'Love Robbie,' Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs,
I, 136.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_97_C">C</a>.</b> 'Brown Robyn and Mally,' Buchan's Ballads of the
North of Scotland, II, 299.</p></div>


<p>'Brown Robin' was No 7 in William Tytler's
Brown MS. The first stanza is cited by
Anderson, Nichols's Literary Illustrations,
VII, 177, and there were twenty-one stanzas,
as in <b>A a</b>. <b>A b</b> may have been a copy of the
Tytler-Brown version. It does not seem to
have been tampered with so much as other
ballads in the same manuscript. The story
undoubtedly stops at the right point in <b>A</b>,
with the escape of the two lovers to the wood.
The sequel in <b>C</b> is not at all beyond the inventive
ability of Buchan's blind beggar, and
some other blind beggar may have contrived
the cane and the whale, the shooting and the
hanging, in <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>Brown Robin is lover or husband of May
Margerie, or May a Roe=Lillie Flower, in
'<a href="#Ballad_90">Jellon Grame</a>,' No 90, <b>B</b> 14, <b>C</b> 7, and again
of White Lilly in '<a href="#Ballad_103">Rose the Red and White
Lilly</a>,' No 103, <b>A</b> 7 ff.</p>

<p>We have money given over the wall by an
eloping lady, as in <b>B</b> 4, 5, <b>C</b> 5, also in '<a href="#Ballad_101">Willie
o Douglas Dale</a>,' No 101, <b>C</b> 4, 5.</p>

<p><b>A</b> 1, nearly, is stanza 5 in Jamieson's 'Glenkindie;'
see p. 141 of this volume, note to <b>B</b>.</p>

<p><b>C</b> is translated by Gerhard, p. 175.</p>

BROWN ADAM</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_98_A">A</a>.</b> 'Brown Adam,' Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 17.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_98_B">B</a>.</b> 'Broun Edom,' Harris MS., fol. 27 b, No 26.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_98_C">C</a>.</b> 'Brown Adam the Smith,' Buchan MSS, I, 46.</p></div>


<p>'Brown Adam' was No 14 of the fifteen
ballads furnished William Tytler by Mrs
Brown in 1783: Anderson, in Nichols's Illustrations,
VII, 178. The ballad was first
printed in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,
II, 16, 1802, with the omission of Mrs
Brown's second stanza, and some changes.
Scott remarks that he had seen a copy printed
on a single sheet.</p>

<p><b>C</b> 1, 3, 6, 7 are very close to <b>A</b> 1, 2, 3, 4.
<b>A</b> 2 was not printed by Scott, and if these
stanzas were borrowed, <b>A</b> 2 must have been
taken from the Jamieson MS., to which other
cases of correspondence warrant a suspicion
that one of Buchan's contributors had access.
<b>C</b> has the usual marks of Buchan's copies,
great length, vulgarity, and such extravagance
and absurdity as are found in stanzas 23, 26,
29.</p>

<p>A Danish ballad, from manuscripts of the
sixteenth century and later, has a remote likeness
to 'Brown Adam:' 'Den afhugne Haand,'
Grundtvig, No 199, IV, 153. Lawi PedersÃ¸n,
who has shown bad faith to women, makes
love to Lutzelil, who knows his ways, and rejects
him summarily. Lawi rides off in wrath,
saying that she shall be sorry for it. The
maid is afraid to go to church for nine months,
but ventures at Easter. Lawi stops her in a
wood. She begs him to do her no harm,
feigns to be amenable, and gives him an assignation
at an off-lying apartment in which
she sleeps with her maids; then rides away,
laughing over her successful evasion. She
tells her father how she has met Lawi, and
begs him to be on the watch. Lawi comes at
night, knocks, and is answered, according to
the formula of Danish ballads, that she has
made no appointment and he cannot come in.
Lawi threatens to take off the door, and does
so. Lutzelil's father is standing ready with
his sword, and cuts off Lawi's hand.</p>

<p><b>A</b> was No 2 of the fifteen ballads in William
Tytler's lost Brown MS.: Nichols's Illustrations,
VII, 176. There is a copy of <b>A</b> in
the Abbotsford MS., "Scottish Songs," fol.
24, with many wilful alterations and a few
readings from tradition. The ballad printed
in Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 204, is a compound
of <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, and the one in Kinloch's
Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 77, is made up
from <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, "recited versions obtained in the
north and west" of Scotland, with some slight
changes.</p>

<p>The story of '<a href="#Ballad_100">Willie o Winsbury</a>,' No 100,
has considerable resemblance to that of
'Johnie Scot,' but Willie's extreme beauty
moves the king, the lady's father, to offer his
daughter to him in marriage, without a combat.
Mrs Brown's version of 'Willie o Douglas
Dale,' No 101, <b>A</b>, begins with the first
stanza of her version of 'Johnie Scot,' <b>A</b>. So
does 'Young Betrice,' another ballad of hers,
No 5 of William Tytler's MS.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Young Betrice was as brave a knight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As ever saild the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he's taen him to the court of France,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To serve for meat and fee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Anderson, who cites this stanza, Nichols's
Illustrations, as above, remarks: "The conduct
of the story is different from that of No
2 ['Jack, the Little Scot'], which it resembles.
Some of the lines are in 'Gil Morrice.'"
'Young Betrice' may possibly be a variety of
'Hugh Spencer:' see 'Hugh Spencer,' <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>There is resemblance to '<a href="#Ballad_83">Child Maurice</a>,'
No 83, besides the commonplace of the messenger-boy,
in the sending of a token to the
lady, <b>A</b> 12, 13, <b>D</b> 6, <b>E</b> 2, <b>H</b> 4, 5, <b>J</b> 4, <b>M</b> 8,
<b>N</b> 11, 12; '<a href="#Ballad_83">Child Maurice</a>,' <b><a href="#Version_83_A">A</a></b> 7, 8, <b><a href="#Version_83_B">B</a></b> 3, 4, <b><a href="#Version_83_C">C</a></b>
3, 4, 5, <b><a href="#Version_83_D">D</a></b>, <b><a href="#Version_83_E">E</a></b> 6, 7, <b><a href="#Version_83_F">F</a></b> 17, 18. In the present ballad
the token is a sark of silk (<b>M</b> 8, simply
shirt); so in '<a href="#Ballad_83">Child Maurice</a>,' <b><a href="#Version_83_D">D</a></b> 7, <b><a href="#Version_83_F">F</a></b> 18. The
blessing on the errand-boy, <b>A</b> 8, is found in
'<a href="#Ballad_91">Fair Mary of Wallington</a>,' No 91, <b><a href="#Version_91_B">B</a></b> 9.</p>

<p>While John, the Scot, is in service at the
English court, the king's daughter becomes
with child to him. She is thrown into prison.
Johnie, who has fled to Scotland, sends a messenger
to her with a token which she will
recognize, urging her to come to him. An
answer is returned that she is in chains.
Johnie resolves to go to the rescue. He is
warned of the danger, but a body of Scots at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-378" id="Pg_2-378">[Pg 378]</a></span>tends
him, five hundred men, <b>A-D</b>, <b>O</b>, twenty-four,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>; all unmarried, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>O</b>. When he arrives at the English court,
the king asks his name. His name is Pitnachton,
<b>A</b> 26; McNaughtan, <b>B</b> 17, <b>E</b> 14, cf. <b>C</b> 16;
Auchney, <b>H</b> 21; Buneftan, <b>I</b> 14; Johnie Scot,
Love John, <b>C</b> 17, <b>K</b> 12, <b>L</b> 13, <b>N</b> 26; Earl
Hector, <b>D</b> 18. The king will hang the Scot
on his daughter's account. Resistance is
threatened by Johnie's friends. The king
has a champion who will fight them three by
three, <b>A</b> 29, <b>B</b> 20, <b>E</b> 18, <b>F</b> 17, <b>N</b> 30. This
champion is an Italian, <b>A</b> 29, <b>I</b> 17, <b>L</b> 16, <b>N</b>
31, <b>O</b> 8; an Itilian, <b>H</b> 27; Talliant, Tailliant,
<b>C</b> 22, <b>D</b> 23, <b>F</b> 17, <b>G</b> 16. The Scot kills the
Italian in a duel. In <b>C</b> 24, <b>D</b> 25, <b>F</b> 19, <b>G</b> 18,
the Italian jumps over Johnie's head, skims
over it like a swallow, and is apparently run
through while so doing. Johnie calls for a
priest to marry his love and him, the king for
a clerk to write the tocher. But tocher is refused
by the Scot, who wants only his dearly
won lady.</p>

<p>The champion is described in <b>A</b> 31 as a
gurious (grugous, gruous?) ghost; in <b>H</b> 27
as a greecy (frightful) ghost; in <b>L</b> 18 he is
a fearsome sight, with three women's-spans
between his brows and three yards between
his shoulders; in the Abbotsford copy of <b>A</b>,
29, 30, a grisly sight, with a span between
his eyes, between his shoulders three and
three, and Johnie scarcely reaching his knee.
These points are probably taken from another
and a later ballad, which is perhaps an imitation,
and might almost be called a parody,
of Johnie Scot, 'Lang Johnny Moir:' see Buchan's
Ballads of the North of Scotland, I,
248.</p>

<p>The process of striping a sword oer a stane
or to the stran, <b>N</b> 28, <b>H</b> 28, striking it across
the plain, <b>A</b> 32, <b>K</b> 14, is that of whetting or
wiping, already noted under No 81, II, 243 f.
To the places cited there may be added 'Child
Maurice,' <b>F</b> 30, '<a href="#Ballad_90">Jellon Grame</a>,' No 90, <b>B</b> 8,
21, <b>C</b> 14, '<a href="#Ballad_112">The Baffled Knight</a>,' No 112, <b>A</b> 10.
<b>G</b> 20<sup>2</sup> is a manifest corruption, a repetition of
17<sup>2</sup>; <b>K</b> 14 has been corrected, in conformity
with <b>A</b> 32.</p>

Fife, 1823, p. 216, relates the following story,
on traditional authority.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> James Macgill, of
Lindores, had killed Sir Robert Balfour, of
Denmiln, in a duel which he had wished to
avoid, about the year 1679. Macgill "immediately
went up to London in order to procure
his pardon, which it seems the king, Charles
the Second, offered to grant him upon condition
of his fighting an Italian gladiator or
bravo, or, as he was then called, a bully; which,
it is said, none could be found to do.... Accordingly
a large stage was erected for the exhibition
before the king and court.... Sir
James, it is said, stood on the defensive till
the bully had spent himself a little, being a
taller man than Sir James. In his mighty
gasconading and bravadoing he actually leaped
over the knight as if he would swallow him
alive, but in attempting to do this a second
time Sir James run his sword up through
him, and then called out, 'I have spitted him;
let them roast him who will.' This not only
procured his pardon, but he was also knighted
on the spot."</p>

<p>The exploit of Johnie Scot, and, if you
please, of Sir James Macgill, has been achieved
as well on the south side of the English Channel.
The Breton seigneur Les Aubrays, or
LizandrÃ©, of St Brieux, is ordered by the
French king to undertake a combat with his
wild Moor. Les Aubrays asks a page, who
brings the king's command, about the Moor's
fashion of fighting. The Moor is master of
devilish magic, and has herbs about him by
virtue of which any wounds he may get are
soon healed. The Breton is told, among other
things, that he must throw holy water at the
Moor the moment the savage draws, and
when the Moor makes a leap in the air he
must receive him on the point of his sword.
These instructions are followed with perfect
success. When the Moor is "swimming" in
the air, LizandrÃ© so disposes his sword as to
take him on it. Luzel, 'Lezobre,' etc., 'Les
Aubrays et le More du Roi,' second and third
versions, I, 300-03, 294, 295; 'Le GÃ©ant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-379" id="Pg_2-379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
LizandrÃ© II, 568-71, 'Le GÃ©ant Les Aubrays,'
576-79; PoÃ©sies populaires de la
France, MS., vol. i, near the beginning.
Though the brave Breton is called giant in
the title of Luzel's last two versions, nothing
is said in the ballads of his being of unusual
proportions. He is victorious in nineteen
fights, but it is because of his profuse liberality
to St Anne; it borders on the irreligious,
therefore, to call him a giant.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The main points of the story of this ballad
are the same in all the copies. The king of
Scotland, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, of France, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, has been away
from home a considerable time, in Spain, <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, a prisoner, <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, a-hunting, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
and during his absence his daughter has become
with child by William or Thomas of
Winsbury. The father threatens to hang the
young man, but on seeing him is so struck with
his beauty that he exonerates his daughter,
and offers her in marriage to her lover, with a
large dowry. Winsbury accepts the lady, but
declines gold and land, having enough of his
own. In <b>H</b> he says he shall be king when he
goes back to Scotland; in the other copies he
appears to be only a man of very good estate.</p>

<p>From the hero turning out to be a royal person
from Scotland, in <b>H</b>, Kinloch, Ancient Scot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-399" id="Pg_2-399">[Pg 399]</a></span>tish
Ballads, p. 89, is led to imagine that the
ballad may relate to James V of Scotland, who
married a daughter of Francis I. His reasons
are, first, that James <i>disguised himself</i> when
he went to inspect the Duke of VendÃ´me's
daughter (to whom he was in a way betrothed),
so as not to be known to her or to her parents.
Secondly, that when James, not fancying this
lady, passed on, it was at a <i>hunting</i>-party
that he met the French princess, who became
so enamored of him that she would have no
other husband. That the poor princess had
long been sick, and "was not able to travel
out of the realm to no other countrie" (on
a milk-white steed, <b>C</b> 13), and that she died
about six months after her marriage, does
not come into the ballad.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Buchan thinks
Winsbury's rank to be fixed by his version,
<b>G</b>, as that of a chamberlain, and therefore
cannot admit the plausibility of a disguised
James V.</p>

<p>The two English copies, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, both imperfect,
change the hero's name to Johnnie Barbary
('lately come from Spain,' cf. <b>B</b> 5) or
Johnnie Barbour. Motherwell, in a manuscript
annotation to Kinloch's Ancient Scottish
Ballads, mentions that he had obtained from
recitation a copy in which the name was
Sweet Willie of Salisbury. The change from
a king to a lady neat and trim in <b>D</b> 1 is a corruption
that one would have hardly looked for
"from the spinning-wheel."</p>

<p>The stanza which notes the reluctance of
the young man to come at call, <b>C</b> 9, <b>D</b> 6, <b>F</b> 12,
occurs in all copies of '<a href="#Ballad_110">The Knight and
Shepherd's Daughter</a>.'</p>

at the time of Henry VIII, used generally to act as Lord of
Misrule in the years 1508-19, and he was Friar Tuck at
Greenwich in May, 1515 (see Collier's Annals of the Stage,
and J. S. Brewer's Letters and Papers of Henry VIII), and
this, no doubt, made the name popular with the ballad-makers."
Ward, Catalogue of Romances, etc., I, 532. Undeniably
the Lord Winsbury of our ballad might be said to have
acted as a lord of misrule, but it was hardly an English (or
Scots) ballad-maker of the sixteenth century that made this
ballad; and Mr. Ward, probably, did not intend so to be
understood.</p></div></div>

<p><b>A</b> was among the fifteen ballads furnished
by Mrs Brown to William Tytler in 1783, No
8. The first stanza is cited by Dr Anderson
in Nichols's Illustrations, VII, 177. There is
a copy in the Abbotsford MS. "Scottish
Songs," fol. 16, in which the text is considerably
altered; stanzas 7, 12, 19, 22-24 are
omitted, and 25 is inserted between 30 and 31.
<b>B b</b> inserts two stanzas after <b>B a</b> 15, and adds
one at the end. The copy in Christie's Traditional
Ballad Airs, II, 32, is an abridgment
of <b>B b</b> as made over in The Ballad Minstrelsy
of Scotland, Glasgow, 1871, p. 63. <b>C</b> has an
appendage of two stanzas which belong to another
ballad, and are transferred accordingly.</p>

<p>The first part of the story of this ballad, or
down to the birth of the boy, is repeated in
'<a href="#Ballad_102">Willie and Earl Richard's Daughter</a>' (hitherto
called 'The Birth of Robin Hood'), which
immediately follows. This portion of the ballad
has resemblances to 'Leesome Brand,' No
15.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_102_C">C</a>.</b> Kinloch's MSS, V, 330 f, two stanzas.</p></div>


<p><b>A</b> was taken down from Mrs Brown's recitation
by Jamieson in 1800, and published in
his collection in 1806, "without the alteration
of a single word." <b>C</b> wrongly forms the conclusion
of '<a href="#Ballad_101">Willie o Douglas Dale</a>,' the preceding
ballad. The copy in Christie's Traditional
Ballad Airs, <b>I</b>, 128, is an abridgment
of <b>B</b>, with a very few trivial changes.</p>

<p>The first half of the story in <b>A</b>, 1-9, is that
of <a href="#Version_101_A">'Willie of Douglas Dale,' <b>A</b></a>, 1-24, and
there is a partial verbal correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In
the latter a shepherd's daughter is engaged as
nurse to the boy born in the wood, and Dame
Oliphant is taken home by her lover and made
lady of Douglas Dale. In the present ballad
the lady's father tracks his daughter to the
wood, finds the new-born child, adopts him as
his grandson, and gives him the name Robin
Hood, Willie [Archibald] disappearing from
the scene.</p>

<p>The first part of <b>B</b> 4-18 is a variety of the
wide-spread tragic ballad of 'Leesome Brand,'
No 15. So, also, is the larger part of '<a href="#Ballad_101">Willie
o Douglas Dale</a>,' with the tragic features
dropped.</p>

<p>This ballad certainly does not belong to the
cycle of Robin Hood, and for this reason the
title hitherto borne by it could not be retained.
The connection with Robin Hood was in all
probability mediated by the name Brown
Robin. Brown Robin plays the part of Willie
[Archibald] in <a href="#Version_103_A">'Rose the Red and White
Lily,' <b>A</b></a> 25-29. Brown Robin's son, in 'Jellon
Grame,' is called Robin after Robin Hood, <b>B</b> 14,
<b>C</b> 7, 17. Brown Robin carries off his love to
the wood in the ballad of the same name. The
Earl of Huntingdon, <b>B</b> 3, 21, has no place in
the ancient traditional ballads of Robin Hood,
but is of later literary invention. <b>A</b> 17, <b>B</b> 1,
<b>C</b> 1, may, however, very well have belonged to
some Robin Hood ballad.</p>

White Lily have a bad step-mother, who,
however, has two good sons that love these
maids: Brown Robin, Lily, and Arthur, Rose.
The maids build a bower, in which the young
people make very merry, and the step-mother,
to spoil sport, tells her sons that they must
sail the sea. Brown Robin goes to the wood,
and Arthur to the king's court. The maids
disguise themselves as men, and take service
with their lovers: White Lily under the
name of Roge the Round, and Rose the Red
under that of Sweet Willy. Before they part
they make a mutual vow that at three blasts
of a horn the one shall come to the other's
help. Once upon a time, when Robin and his
men are putting the stone, Roge sets it seven
foot beyond all the rest, but, having exerted
herself too much in so doing, is fain to lean
her back against an oak and utters a moan, by
which Brown Robin perceives that Roge is a
woman. Forty weeks after this Roge has occasion
for the aid of a bower-wife. Brown
Robin proffers his help, but it is declined;
nevertheless, with an apparent but not a real
inconsistency, the lady asks him to blow her
horn, for she has a brother at the court who
will come to her upon the sound. Robin replies
that if she has a brother whom she loves
better than him she may blow the horn herself.
This she does, and Sweet Willy comes
at once. Brown Robin will let no man enter
the bower without a fight. Rose the Red is
wounded, and avows herself to be a woman.
Brown Robin is distressed: he wished never
to see a woman's blood, for the sake of a maid
named White Lily. Roge the Round reveals
herself as that same. Word comes to the
king's court that Brown Robin's man has
borne a son, and the king declares that he will
go to the wood to inquire into this marvel.
Arthur will go with him, to find a foot-page
who had left him. Arrived at the wood, Arthur
blows his horn, and Sweet Willy comes
running to him. Arthur asks the page why
he had run away, and is told that it was to
see a brother that lives in the wood. The
king enters the bower, and finds White Lily
nursing her son. This leads to an explanation
on the part of Rose the Red. Brown
Robin, coming in from hunting, starts to see
the king. The king bids him have no fear,
but quit the wood and come to court. Brown
Robin and White Lily, Arthur and Rose the
Red, go to church and are married.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b> the two maids, ill-treated by their
step-mother, betake themselves to the wood,
where they meet, not Brown Robin, but Robin
Hood, and take service with him. Rose and
Lily change parts; Rose, under the name of
Nicholas, consorting with Robin Hood, and
Lily, <i>alias</i> Roger Brown, with Little John.
It is not, however, Robin Hood and Little
John who turn out to be their lovers, but "a
lad in the company," and "another youth
among the company," stanzas 30, 51. Nothing
is said of the king.</p>

<p>In the fragmentary <b>C</b> the maids are daughters
of a king. Their proper names are not
given, and we do not learn that the stepmother
has a pair of sons. In consequence of
the harshness of their step-mother, these king's
daughters go to the wood as Nicholas and
Rogee Roun, to seek Robin Hood, and they
are discovered to be maids by a song which
Rogee sings. Rogee is wedded to Robin Hood,
and Nicholas to Little John.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the Robin Hood of <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, was suggested by the Brown Robin of <b>A</b>.
The name Barnsdale in <b>A</b> 12, 51 has certainly
been adopted from the Robin Hood cycle, but
in the present ballad is the residence of the
father of Rose and Lily, not that of Robin
Hood.</p>

<p>The only part of the ballad which has the
stamp of indubitably ancient tradition is the
child-birth in the wood, and this scene is the
rightful, and perhaps exclusive, property of
'Leesome Brand,' No 15: see I, 182. <b>A</b> 24-29,
<b>B</b> 40-47, are found again in '<a href="#Ballad_101">Willie o
Douglas Dale</a>,' <b><a href="#Version_101_A">A</a></b> 15-17, 22, 23, <b><a href="#Version_101_B">B</a></b> 18, 19, 22,
24, <b><a href="#Version_101_C">C</a></b> 8-10, and the first part of 'Willie o
Douglas Dale,' as well as of the ballad which
immediately precedes the present, commonly
called 'The Birth of Robin Hood,' is a variation
of 'Leesome Brand.'</p>

<p>Robin Hood has no love-story in any ancient
ballad, though his name has been foisted into
modern love-ballads, as in 'Robin Hood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-417" id="Pg_2-417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
the Tanner's Daughter,' No 8 <b>C</b>. Maid Marian
is a late accretion. There is a piteously
vulgar broadside, in which Maid Marian, being
parted from Robin Hood, dresses herself "like
a page" (but armed fully), meets Robin Hood,
also under disguise, and has an hour's fight
with him. There is so far a resemblance in
this to <b>A</b> 30 ff, <b>B</b> 49, that a woman disguised
as a page fights with Robin Hood. I suppose
the resemblance to be accidental, but whether
it be or not, the question of 'Rose the Red and
White Lily' being originally a Robin Hood
ballad is not affected.</p>

<p><b>A</b> 3, <b>B</b> 5, is like <b>C</b> 6 of '<a href="#Version_72_C">The Clerk's Twa
Sons o Owsenford</a>,' No 72.</p>

PRINCE HEATHEN</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_104_A">A</a>.</b> 'The Disconsolate Lady,' The Jovial Rake's Garland,
n. d., p. 6, No 4.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_104_B">B</a>.</b> 'Prince Heathen,' Buchan's MSS, I, 97; Motherwell's
MS., p. 665.</p></div>


<p>The fragment <b>A</b> (pointed out to me by
Svend Grundtvig) is partly explained by <b>B</b>,
which is no doubt some stall-copy, reshaped
from tradition. Motherwell's copy was derived
from Buchan.</p>

<p>The story, which reads like an old one extremely
corrupted, is none too intelligible even
in the longer form. Lady Margery is sitting
in her bower-door. Prince Heathen comes by
and gives her a ring. She refuses him her
love. He swears that he will make her greet;
she swears that he shall not. He takes her
maidenhead: still she will not greet. He tells
her that he has killed her father, mother, and
seven brothers: still she will not greet. He
puts her in a vault of stone, fastened with five
and thirty locks: she will not greet [go, <b>A</b>],
but rues. He comes back from the mountains,
and asks her how she is faring. Dying, she
says. He takes her out upon the green, allowing
her no female service, and she brings forth
a son. How is it with her now? Dying. She
asks for a drink of water: he will not give
her a drop until she wraps up her young son.
She has nothing to wrap the babe in; he gives
her his horse-sheet; her tears fall fast. "Bonny
may, now you greet!" he exclaims ["will
you go now?" <b>A</b>]. But she greets not for him;
it is for her young son, wrapped so roughly.
Prince Heathen, satisfied, as far as we can see,
now that he has subdued her proud will, orders
his son to be rolled in silk and washed in
milk, according to the usage of Scottish nursery:
see No 5, <b>B</b> 61, <b>C</b> 82, 83, <b>E</b> 32, <b>F</b> 57,
<b>G</b> 33; No 20, <b>C</b> 8; No 63, <b>B</b> 35, <b>C</b> 35, <b>F</b> 22,
<b>J</b> 47; No 101, <b>A</b> 25. Having broken her
spirit, he loves her well.</p>

THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER OF ISLINGTON</h2>

<p>Reprinted in Percy's Reliques, III, 133,
1765, from the Pepys copy, <b>c</b>, but "with some
improvements, communicated by a lady as she
heard the same repeated in her youth;" that
is, in fact, a few casual verbal variations, attributable
to imperfect recollection of a broadside.
There are much better in a copy which
I have received from an Irish lady, partly
made over by secondary tradition. Reprinted
also by Ritson, A Select Collection of English
Songs, II, 234, 1783, apparently from <b>a</b>, with
an arbitrary change in st. 8<sup>2</sup>, and one or two
other variations. Mr F. H. Stoddard informs
me that 'The Bailiff's Daughter' is still very
much sung, and may be heard any day at a
country cricket-match.</p>

<p>A fond youth and a coy maid, a bailiff's
daughter, having been parted seven years, the
maid disguises herself to go in quest of her
lover, and meets him on her way. He asks
her whether she knows the bailiff's daughter.
The bailiff's daughter is dead long ago, she
replies. Then he will go into a far country.
The maid, assured of his faith, reveals herself,
and is ready to be his bride.</p>

<p>This is the counterpart of a ballad found in
other languages (and represented in English
by Percy's cento 'The Friar of Orders Gray,'
Reliques, I, 225, 1765), in which a man tells
a woman that the object of her affection,
lover, or more commonly husband, is dead.

<p>This ballad was given in Percy's Reliques,
III, 87, 1765, "from a written copy, containing
some improvements (perhaps modern
ones)." These improvements are execrable
in style and in matter, so far as there is new
matter, but not in so glaring contrast with the
groundwork as literary emendations of traditional
ballads. Ritson reprinted in A Select
Collection of English Songs, II, 244, 1783,
some broadside like that which was followed
by <b>c</b>.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 96), and also a
fragment with the same title in the Harris
MS., fol. 20 f, No 15, are derived from the
broadside through recitation. A copy in Buchan's
MSS, I, 150, is taken directly from
print.</p>

<p>In other cases portions of the broadside appear
to have entered into combination with
traditional verses belonging to some other
story, or possibly to some older form of this.</p>

<p>Scott inserted in his Border Minstrelsy, III,
83, 1803, seven stanzas under the title of 'The
Lament of the Border Widow,' which show
broader traces of the sheet-ballad (1-3), and
also, as Aytoun has remarked, agreements with
'The Three Ravens' and with 'Fair Helen of
Kirconnell' (5-7). 'The Lament of the Border
Widow,' "obtained from recitation in the
Forest of Ettrick," has been thought to relate
to the execution of Cokburne, a border-freebooter,
by James V. Those who are interested
in such random inventions (as, under pardon,
they must be called) will find particulars in
Scott's introduction, and a repetition of the
same in Maidment's Scotish Ballads and Songs,
Historical and Traditionary, II, 170.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>"Dr Blacklock informed Burns that this
song... was composed on the horrid massacre
at Glencoe": Stenhouse's note, IV, 92.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The English broadside, which may reasonably
be believed to be formed upon a predecessor
in the popular style, has been held to
have a common origin with the Scandinavian
ballad 'Maid and Stable Boy,' already spoken
of under '<a href="#Ballad_63">Child Waters</a>' at p. 84f of this
volume. The points of resemblance are that
a maid cuts her hair, dons man's clothes, and
seeks service with a king. In the end she is
married to the king's son, or to a nobleman of
his court. The differences, in other respects,
are considerable.</p>

<p>Percy's ballad is translated by Bodmer, I,
160; by Merk, Ursinus, p. 79, and Bothe, p.
307; by DÃ¶ring, p. 329.</p>

WILL STEWART AND JOHN</h2>

<p>The fragment <b>B</b> is disordered as well as
mutilated. <b>B</b> 1 corresponds to <b>A</b> 18, 13; 2 to
14; 3 to 19, 40; 4 to 41, 42; 5 to 43; 6 to 35,
36; 7 to 17. It is simply a confused recollection
of some parts of the ballad.</p>

<p>The first stanza furnishes a sort of general
lyrical introduction, and does not belong to
the story, to which, as I conceive, the circumstance
that Adlatts Park is wide and broad is
of no more special pertinence than the other
which follows, that grass grows green in our
countrye. See I, 7, note.</p>

<p>Will Stewart, of Argyle Castle, languishes
with love for the Earl of Mar's daughter, and
lies in care-bed. His younger brother, John, a
wiser man, offers to go a-wooing for his brother,
and to forward his object takes service with
the Earl of Mar as chamberlain to his daughter.
One Sunday, as John is conveying the
lady home from church, he makes known to
her that he is a messenger. The lady at
first, like Shakspere's Olivia, would rather
he should speak for himself, but upon hearing
what John has to say for his brother is ready
to love Will heartily. She bids her lover
come with a hundred men to a foot-ball match
on Sunday after St Andrew's day. He must
play sixteen games, and if he win the greater
part she shall love him the more. This tidings
makes Will Stewart leap from care-bed.
He chooses a hundred men from eleven score
and three, dresses them in green, himself in
scarlet (about which the lady had been particular),
meets his mistress at the rendezvous,
gives her a kiss of courtesy, and wins twelve
of the sixteen games. The Earl of Mar invites
Will to his house, where the Stewart
avows his love for his daughter; he knows
not whether the lady loves him. "God forbid!"
exclaims the earl. "I would rather
thou wert hanged or burned. To thy chamber,
lady, or I will beat thee before the
Stewart's eye." Will, with John, who renounces
Mar's service, returns to Argyle Castle,
and Will leaps into care-bed again. A
parliament is held at Edinburgh, to which
both brothers are summoned. Mar discovers
that Will is an earl's son, and even the king's
cousin, but this discovery has no effect to
change the mind of the peremptory nobleman.
Will and John go back to Argyle Castle
when the parliament is done, and Will once
more leaps into care-bed. John, in great concern
for his brother, offers to go a-wooing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-433" id="Pg_2-433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
him again. He disguises himself as a beggar,
comes to Mar's house on a dole-day, makes his
way to the lady and sticks by her till all the
beggars are gone, and then tells her that he is
no beggar, but a messenger. The lady, reproached
for her cruelty, says the blame is
not hers, and appoints Will to meet her within
three days at Martinsdale with a hundred
men, they and he dressed as before. Will
leaps out of care-bed, chooses a hundred of the
best out of eleven score men and three, rides
to Martinsdale, and finds the true lady waiting
for him. They send for priest and clerk and
are married, and she goes home with Will.
A twelvemonth after, John is despatched to
bid the Earl of Mar to a christening. John
frightens the earl with an intimation that his
daughter will now be returned on his hands.
This brings the wilful father round. The
marriage ceremony is performed over again,
and Will made Earl of Mar.</p>

<p>As Mr Hales has remarked, Bishop Percy's
Folio Manuscript, III, 215, the allusions to
manners and customs are highly interesting:
as, to foot-ball matches, 27; to the kiss of courtesy,
35<sup>3</sup>; to the beating of daughters, 42<sup>4</sup>,
43<sup>3</sup>; to the dole-day, 66<sup>2</sup>; to the beggar's dress
and equipment, 61, 78<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The superfluous <i>that</i> in 3<sup>4</sup>, 16<sup>3</sup>, 18<sup>4</sup>, 38<sup>1</sup>, 68<sup>1</sup>,
89<sup>2</sup>, is common in the ballads of the Percy
manuscript.</p>

CHRISTOPHER WHITE</h2>

<p>'Christopher White,' Percy MS., p. 513; Hales and Furnivall, III, 494.</p>


<p>A rich merchant, burgess of Edinburgh,
overhears a lady making moan for Christopher
White, who is banished from England. He
makes her great offers to abandon Christopher
and lay her love on him. She resists
these offers at first, and tells him that if she
is false to Christopher she cannot be true to
him. But silver and gold makes her heart
turn and makes her leave good company. After
she has been married two or three months
tidings come to Edinburgh that all the merchants
must to sea; it is for service against
Spain, 17<sup>4</sup>. The lady takes advantage of her
husband's absence to write to Christopher;
she sends him a hundred pound and bids him
come to Edinburgh. Christopher first goes to
London and obtains pardon of the king of
England, then makes for Edinburgh. The
lady tells him that she is a merchant's wife,
and he shall have enough of the merchant's
gold. Christopher, who seems not till then to
have known of her marriage, begins an indignant
answer, but the lady cuts him short with
an offer to go to England with him. They
pack up silver and gold and make off to Little
England, whatever that may be (perhaps a
Percy MS. phrase: see 'Hugh Spencer,' st.
34). The merchant comes back, and is told
that his wife has fled with Christopher. He
does not care for the loss of silver and gold,
but mourns for the lady, who, he frankly
owns, had given him due warning of what he
might look for.</p>

<h2><a name="Ballad_109" id="Ballad_109">109</a><br />
TOM POTTS</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_109_A">A</a>.</b>
'Thomas of Potte,' Percy MS., p. 409; Hales and
Furnivall, III, 135.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_109_B">B</a>.</b>
'The Lovers Quarrel, or, Cupid's Triumph,' etc.
<b>a.</b> London, printed for F. Coles, and others, 1677,
<b>b.</b> Pepys Merriments, I, 189; Ritson, Pieces of Ancient
Popular Poetry, p. 115, 1791.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_109_C">C</a>.</b> 'The Two Constant Lovers in Scotland,' etc.,
broadside of 1657; Ritson's Ancient Songs, 1790, p.
248.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the copies here printed are of the seventeenth
century, and the ballad need not be
put much beyond that date. Modernized editions,
differing much, were issued in the century
following, perhaps earlier, some of which
have a Second Part, narrating the happy married
life of Tom Potts, Lord Arundel, and
Fair Rosamund. See Halliwell's Descriptive
Notices of Popular English Histories, p. 17,
No 15, Percy Society, vol. xxiii, and the notes
to <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>Unequal matches are common enough in
ballads and romances, and very naturally, since
they are an easy expedient for exciting interest,
at least with those who belong to the
humbler party. We have other ballad-examples
of disparagement on the female side in
'The Bonny Foot-Boy' and 'Ritchie Storie.'
No offence seems to be given when King
Cophetua weds the Beggar-Maid, but when the
Lady of the Strachy marries the Yeoman of
the Wardrobe good taste is shocked. Such
events would be celebrated only by fellows of
the yeoman or of the foot-boy, and surely in
the present case the minstrel was not much
above the estate of the serving-man. Lord
Jockey's reckless liberality throughout, and
Lord Phenix's in the end, is a mark of the
serving-man's ideal nobleman.</p>

<p>Tom Potts stanches his blood with a charm
in <b>A</b> 75<sup>4</sup>, <b>B</b> 82<sup>4</sup>, just as the sons of Autolycus
do that of Ulysses in Odyssey <span class="smcap">XIX</span>, 457 f.
His rejecting of his master's thirty fine horses
in favor of the old white cut-tail is a ludicrous
repetition of Hugh Spencer's preference of the
hack he had brought over sea, and Walter
of Aquitaine's predilection for his worn-out
charger. See, further on, 'Hugh Spencer's
Feats in France.'</p>

<p>There is a Lord Phenix in a sufficiently absurd
ballad in Motherwell's MS., 'Jamie o
Lee,' p. 654; an English nobleman who steals
the Queen of Scotland's jewels and lays the
blame on Jamie o Lee, a page of fifteen years,
being himself, for rhyme's sake, thretty three.
The page worsts his accuser in a duel and
makes him confess.</p>

<p>Mr Macmath notes for me that Swift, in
The Tale of a Tub (written about 1696),
having associated Dryden's Hind and Panther
with Tom Thumb, Whittington and his Cat,
and other "prime productions of our society,"
adduces Tommy Potts as "another piece, supposed
by the same hand, by way of supplement
to the former:" Scott's edition, XI, 72.</p>

<p>The message to Strawberry Castle occurs
also in No 65, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and No 87 <b>C</b>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>B</b> is translated by Bothe, p. 315.</p>

<p>The only English version of this ballad is
a broadside, found in the Roxburghe Collection.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
It was given from a black-letter copy,
with changes and the omission of stanza 4,
in the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,
1765, III, 75. Hearne, in his preface to Guilielmi
Neubrigensis Historia, I, lxx (cited by
Percy), remarks that some impressions were
adorned with the picture of a queen, meant, as
he maintains, to be Elizabeth, and quotes the
first stanza.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> From this Percy infers that the
ballad was popular in Elizabeth's time, a supposition
probable enough in itself, and confirmed
by the fifteenth stanza occurring (as
Percy notes) in Fletcher's comedy of 'The
Pilgrim,' 1621.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Motherwell, Minstrelsy, Introduction, p.
lxvi, says that the ballad was current in Scotland
in many shapes (1827).</p>

<p>The copy in Kinloch's Ancient Scottish
Ballads, p. 13, is <b>C</b>, with the stanzas given here
as <b>D</b> incorporated into it from another version.</p>

<p>Kinloch is fully justified in claiming for the
Scottish ballad a decided superiority. The
humorous artifices which the lady practises to
maintain the character of a beggar's brat are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-458" id="Pg_2-458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
as he says, kept up with great spirit and fancy,
and, as far as we know, are entirely of Scottish
invention. It might perhaps be objected
that in the course of tradition they have been
exaggerated in later copies to a point threatening
weariness.</p>

<p>The passage in which the knight rides off
and is followed so closely by the maid, through
river and all, <b>A</b> 6-8, <b>B</b> 5-10, etc., is found also
in '<a href="#Ballad_63">Child Waters</a>,' <b>A</b> 11-16, <b>B</b> 4-11, etc., and
suits both ballads perhaps equally well.</p>

<p>Parts of this ballad inevitably suggest a
parallel with the tales belonging to the class
of the 'Marriage of Sir Gawain.'<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> In the
Wife of Bath's Tale, a lusty bachelor who has
been out hawking meets a maid walking, and
forces her to yield to his will. The offence is
brought before King Arthur,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and the knight,
as he is also called, is condemned to death.
The alternative of marrying is so distasteful
to him that he tries every means to avoid it.
'Take all my good,' he says to the woman,
'but let my body go.' But all for naught.
Dame Ragnell makes a point of being wedded
in high style; so does our shepherd's daughter
in <b>E</b> 37, 38, <b>F</b> 38, 39. In Gower, the knight
takes the woman on his horse and rides away
sighing; and they also have a cauld and eerie
ride in <b>E</b> 39. The bride becomes, if possible,
more and more repulsive in the Gawain tales,
and endeavors to make herself so in the ballad.
As in the tales, so in the ballad, the
bridegroom will not turn about and make
much of her, <b>C</b> 29, <b>E</b> 56, <b>G</b> 30. The ugly woman
turns out to be a king's daughter in
Gower's tale, a most desirable wife in all the
others; and the shepherdess is a king's daughter
in <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>K</b>, and at least an excellent
match in other copies. The knight is nephew
to a king or emperor in three of the tales, and
the queen's brother or the king's in nearly all
the ballads.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Even the Billy Blin in <b>F</b> 60-63,
<b>G</b> 31, 32, cf. <b>D</b> 15,16, looks like a remnant of
the fairy machinery of the Gawain tales.</p>

<p>The tragic ballad of 'Ebbe Galt,' Danske
Viser, II, 47, No 63, has several features in
common with '<a href="#Ballad_110">The Knight and Shepherd's
Daughter</a>.' Ebbe Galt has been drinking
heavily with the king's men. Riding home
through a wood, he meets in an evil hour a
farmer's pretty wife, and offers her presents to
show him the way to the town. She undertakes
to do so, though much afraid. They
come to the farmer's house. Ebbe Galt begins
to ban and beat, and in the end ravishes the
woman, using extreme cruelty. She says, Now
you have had your will of me, with little good
to either of us, for God's sake tell me your
name.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> He declares himself to be Ebbe Galt.
The farmer comes home and is told all. He
comforts his wife and goes to make his plaint
to the king. If any man in the court has done
this, says the king, it shall cost him his life.
When he learns that the man is his nephew, he
would rather than half Denmark not have pronounced
so harsh a doom. Ebbe Galt is summoned
to answer for himself. He is not much
better sober than drunk, though the ballad
lays the fault on ale. He tells the farmer to
produce his wife; she will make no complaint.
The woman gives her evidence. She had
treated Ebbe Galt with all hospitality as her
husband's guest. He had broken in the doors
of the room where she was with her children,
beaten five maids and killed three swains.
Ebbe's father offers his horse and a thousand
mark as ransom. The king says that he himself,
if it lay in him, would have redeemed the
youth with three thousand; Ebbe Galt shall
die. While they are taking him off, Ebbe is
flippant: he would not mind losing his life
had the woman been prettier.</p>

<p>There is a very favorite Scandinavian ballad,
see 'TÃ¦rningspillet,' Grundtvig, IV, 402, No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-459" id="Pg_2-459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
238, in which a fair lady challenges a young
horse-boy, or boatswain, to play tables with
her, and after having won from him all he has,
stakes herself against his shoes or the like.
The youth now wins; she makes him handsome
offers, rising constantly in value, to let
her off, but he will not. God pity me! she
says; but he reveals to her that her case is not
a bad one, for he is the best king's son in the
world.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>An imitation of the English ballad by Laplace,
'Lise et Mainfroi,' 1740, terminates
more sentimentally. The shepherdess persists
that she will have the hand which the king
has awarded her, until she stands before the altar.
She then declares that her sense of honor
has been satisfied, and resigns a very advantageous
match (for she is not a princess in disguise),
with "Puisses-tu du moins quelquefois
te souvenir de ta bergÃ¨re!" Mainfroi exclaims
in a transport, Stay, deign to be my wife! the
king and all the court unite in the entreaty,
and Lise yields. She certainly is entitled to
a statuette in porcelain. See Charles Malo,
Les Chansons d'Autrefois, pp. 124-128.</p>

rather of that kind which, for convenience,
may be called the minstrel-ballad. It has,
however, popular features, and markedly in
stanzas 13, 14; for which see pp. 444, 446 of
the first volume, and the ballad preceding
this, <b>A</b> 5, 6, <b>B</b> 3, 4, etc.; also Buchan's Ballads

<p><b>A b</b> is in the first volume of the editions of
1698, 1707: Chappell, Popular Music, p. 62.
<b>B</b> is in the third volume of the edition of
1707, and is also printed in A Complete Collection
of Old and New English and Scotch
Songs, 8vo, 1735, which I have not seen:
Chappell, p. 520.</p>

<p>The original story, represented by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
and <b>C</b> 1-17, appears to have been revived at
the end of the seventeenth century, and to
have been so much relished as to encourage
the addition of a Second, Third, and Fourth
Part, all of which were afterwards combined,
as in <b>C a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-480" id="Pg_2-480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>
<p>Percy inserted a version of <b>C</b>, abridged to
forty-five stanzas, in his Reliques, 1765, III,
238, 1767, II, 339, which was "given, with
some corrections,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> from a MS. copy, and collated
with two printed ones in Roman character
in the Pepys collection." Although "MS.
copy" in Percy's case may mean nothing,
while "some corrections" may signify much,
it has been thought best to reprint Percy's
ballad in an Appendix.</p>

<p><b>D</b> is repeated in Johnson's Museum, p. 490,
No 477, with a slight change in the first line.
It probably belongs to the first half of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p><b>E</b> is, in all probability, a broadside copy
modified by tradition. In <b>E</b>, as in two stanzas
appended to <b>B</b> (see notes), and in a rifacimento
immediately to be mentioned, the all
but too politic maid would certainly seem to
be encouraging the knight at first.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>'The Politick Maid,' Roxburghe Ballads, I,
306 f, Ballad Society reprint, II, 281, is an
edition, after Percy's fashion, of some old form
of the ballad, by Richard Climsell (Chappell).
It was printed for Thomas Lambert,
whose date, according to Mr. Chappell, is
1636-41, and is, therefore, considerably earlier
than any known copy of the First Part of <b>C</b>.
For the sake of such portions of the original
as it preserves, it is given in an Appendix.</p>

<p>There is a Scottish ballad in which the
tables are turned upon the maid in the conclusion.
This, as being of comparatively recent,
and not of popular, but of low literary origin,
cannot be admitted here. It can be found in
Kinloch's Ballad Book, 'Jock Sheep,' p. 16,
and the Kinloch MSS, I, 229, communicated
by James Beattie as taken down from the
recitation of Miss E. Beattie, Mearnsshire.
Other versions are, in the Campbell MSS,
'Dernie Hughie,' II, 233; 'Jock Sheep, or,
The Maiden Outwitted,' Buchan MSS, 1, 155.
Another ballad, brief and silly, in which a
maid ties a gentleman's hands with her apron
strings, 'The Abashed Knight,' Buchan's Ballads
of the North of Scotland, II, 131, is rejected
on similar grounds.</p>

<p>The important points in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and the first
part of <b>C</b> are that a knight, coming upon a
damsel at a distance from her home, desires to
have his will of her. She asks him to take her
to her father's hall, where he shall be gratified.
Reaching the house, she slips in and
leaves the knight without. She jeers at him
for not using his opportunity.</p>

<p>A similar story occurs in many European
ballads.</p>

<p><b>Spanish. A.</b> 'De Francia partiÃ³ la niÃ±a,'
"Cancionero de Romances, s. a., fol. 259,
Can. de Rom. 1550, fol. 274, Silva de 1550,
I, fol. 184;" 'La Infantina,' Duran, I, 152,
No 284, Wolf y Hofmann, Primavera, II, 82,
No 154. A damsel on the way to Paris has
lost the road, and is waiting under a tree for an
escort. A knight rides by, and she asks him
to take her along. He puts her on the crupper,
and, when midway, asks for <i>amores</i>. The
damsel tells him that she is a leper (hija de
un malato y de una malatÃ­a), which frightens
the knight to silence. As they are entering
Paris the damsel laughs, and the knight asks
why; she laughs at the knight's want of spirit.
He proposes to go back for something which
he has forgotten. She will not turn back; she
is daughter to the king of France, and any
man who should touch her would pay dearly
for it. <b>B.</b> Another copy, from a broadside of
the sixteenth century, Duran, I, 152, No 285,
Primavera, II, 83, No 154 a, blends the story
with that of a princess who has been made to
pass seven years in a wood by a fairy's spell,
'A cazar va el caballero,' 'La Infanta encantada,'
Duran, I, 159, No 295, Primavera, II,
74, No 151. <b>C.</b> 'El Caballero burlado,' from
Asturian tradition, Amador de los Rios, Historia
de la Litteratura espaÃ±ola, VII, 442.</p>

certainly a false one in the present instance.
In <b>A</b> the damsel represents herself as having
been bewitched before baptism, and any man
who should come near her would become <i>malato</i>.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>

he makes love to her; she advises him to
keep off; she is the daughter of a leper. When
out of the wood she laughs, and, the man asking
why, says, because she has come out a
maid. He proposes to return, which she will
not hear of; he should have plucked his bird
while he had it in hand. She declares herself
daughter of the king, <b>D</b>; of the seigneur, <b>E</b>;
of the chief burgher of the city, <b>A</b>. The
knight of <b>B</b> is an officer in <b>E</b>, who takes the
maid up on his horse, and in <b>E</b> she feigns to
be the hangman's daughter, not a leper's.
Inferior copies of the same type are given by
Legrand, Romania, X, 392, No 43, Lovell,
Chansons Canadiennes, p. 30, Gagnon, p. 92
(much corrupted).</p>

<p>In a variation of this story an orange-girl
delivers herself from her predicament by feigning
an ague-fit: 'La Marchande d'Oranges,'
Rolland, p. 258, No 127, <i>d</i>; PoÃ©sies pop. de la
France, IV, fol. 166, fol. 213 (a fragment at
fol. 286 is the latter half of the same copy);
Bujeaud, I, 249, and 251 (marchande de
pommes). Other copies give the story a different
turn.</p>

<p>In another version the man yields to the
girl's tears, and is laughed at in the conclusion:
'Le galant maladroit,' PoÃ©sies pop. de la
France, MS., III, fol. 139, fol. 141; 'La fille

<p><b>Italian.</b> 'La figlia del re,' Ferraro, Canti
p. monferrini, p. 76, No 55. A damsel lost
in a wood asks a cavalier to show her the way.
He takes her on his horse. She, for a reason
not given, but to be gathered from the other
southern ballads, tells him that she is daughter
of a poor man who has had seven years of
sickness. Get down from the horse, he says,
and I will show you the way. At the end of
the wood she tells him she is daughter of a
rich merchant, proprietor of many farms. He
solicits her to mount again. No; he has had
the quail and let it fly; yonder is the castle
of her father the king.</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> 'I Rosenslund,' Grundtvig, IV,
357, No 230, four copies: <b>A</b>, previously in
Levninger, II, 51, No 9, <b>C</b>, "Tragica, No 14,"
1657, Danske Viser, III, 94, No 122. <b>D</b> has
a false conclusion. In <b>A</b>, the best copy, from
MSS of the seventeenth century, a knight
who is hawking and hunting finds a damsel
in a wood. She has been there all night, she
says, listening to the birds. He says, Not so,
it is a tryst with a knight; and she owns that
this is the case. He proposes that she shall
throw over this lover and accept him. She
will not give her faith to two, and asks him
for his honor's sake to convey her to her
bower. She rides, he walks; and when they
come to the bower she locks him out, wishing
him ill night and laughing as he rides away.</p>

<p>'Den dyre Kaabe,' Grundtvig, IV, 362, No
231, two copies, from MSS of the seventeenth
century. A maid and a young man meet in
a wood or mead. She invites him to spread
both of their cloaks on the ground for a bed.
His new scarlet cloak cost him fifteen mark in
Stockholm, and he will not spoil it by laying
it in the dew. If he will wait, she will go
home to her mother's, not far, and bring a
bolster. She goes off laughing and leaves him
expecting her all that day and the next, but
she does not come back. Eight weeks after
he meets her at the church door and asks an
explanation. He may thank his cloak of scarlet
new for his disappointment; had she been
a young man and met a maid, she would not
have spared her cloak though it were cloth of
gold. The reference to Stockholm points to a
Swedish origin for this ballad, but it is not,
says Grundtvig, extant in Swedish.</p>

<p><b>German.</b> 'Das MÃ¤ntelein,' "Frankfurter
Liederbuch 1584, No 150," Uhland, p. 245, No
106, Mittler, No 32. A young man and maid
go out into the green three hours before day.
After rebuffing him, she strangely asks him,
as if she knew that he would not consent, to
spread his cloak on the grass. His cloak cost
him fifty pound, and would be spoiled. In
the evening, as she stands in her tower, the
young man passes and greets her. She answers,
The angels above will requite your cloak
for my coming off a maid.</p>

<p>The artifice by which the lady disembarrasses
herself in the Third Part of the broadside
ballad, by pulling off the knight's boots
half-way, is a very familiar story, found also
in a modern German ballad, Walter, p. 94,
No 64. See Les cent nouvelles Nouvelles,
1432 and earlier, No 24, ed. Wright, Paris,
1858, I, 128; Hondorff, Promptuarium Exemplorum,
"1572, fol. 310," 1586, 362 b;
Kirchhof, Wendunmuth, 1562, ed. Oesterley,
III, 228, and other places, besides these, cited
by Oesterley, IV, 101.</p>

<p>A modern French ballad, attributed to Favart,
which may very probably have had a
basis in popular tradition, celebrates the <i>fille
d'honneur</i> who escapes from the importunity
of her seigneur by distracting his attention
(as the lady does in the second adventure in
English <b>C</b>), and leaping on to the horse from
which he had dismounted to make love to her,
in some versions taking his valise with her:

who solicits her carry her over a river,
then holds him off by promises while they

THE GREAT SILKIE OF SULE SKERRY</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Proceedings of The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,
I, 86, 1852. Communicated by the late Captain
F. W. L. Thomas, R. N.; written down by him
from the dictation of a venerable lady of Snarra Voe,
Shetland.</p></div>


<p>This Shetland ballad<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> was reprinted in Colburn's
New Monthly Magazine, April, 1864,
with spelling Scotticized, and two or three
other uncalled-for changes.</p>

<p>"Finns," as they are for the most part
called, denizens of a region below the depths
of the ocean, are able to ascend to the land
above by donning a seal-skin, which then
they are wont to lay off, and, having divested
themselves of it, they "act just like men and
women." If this integument be taken away
from them, they cannot pass through the sea
again and return to their proper abode, and
they become subject to the power of man, like
the swan-maidens and mer-wives of Scandinavian
and German tradition: Grimm's Mythologie,
I, 354f. Female Finns, under these circumstances,
have been fain to accept of human
partners. The Great Selchie, or Big Seal, of
Shul Skerry, had had commerce with a woman
during an excursion to the upper world. See
Hibbert's Description of the Shetland Islands,
pp. 566-571, and Karl Blind in the Contemporary
Review, XL, 404, 1881. A correspondent
of Blind gives stanza 3 with a slight variation,
thus:</p>

<h3>VOL. I.</h3>


<h4>1. Riddles Wisely Expounded.</h4>

<p>I, 2 b. Russian riddle-songs: Trudy, III, 314, No
44; V, 1073, No 208, 1190, No 6.</p>

<p>The Russian riddle-ballad of the merchant's son.
Add: Shein, Russkiya Narodnuiya Pyesni, Plyasovuiya,
Dance Songs, Nos 88, 87, 89, p. 233 f.</p>


<h4>2. The Elfin Knight.</h4>

<p>P. 8 a, second paragraph. Russian ballad of Impossibilities
propounded reciprocally by youth and maid
(including a shirt): Shein, Russkiya N. P., Plyasovuiya,
Nos 85, 86, p. 231 f.</p>

<p>13. Another Clever Wench, in Hurwitz's Hebrew
Tales, New York, 1847, p. 154, Nos 61, 62; or Sagen
der HebrÃ¤er aus dem Englischen, u. s. w., Leipzig, 1828,
p. 129, Nos 56, 57.</p>

<p>14 a, line 16. The Rusalka ballad, also in Trudy, III,
190, No 7.</p>

<p>14 a, the first paragraph. In the third or "Forest"
book of the Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata, chapters 311-313, is a story
that bears marks of being an ancient part of the compilation.
Yudhishthira and his four younger brothers are
distressed with thirst. The eldest sends these one after
another in quest of water. Each reaches a lake and
hears a voice of a sprite in the air, "I have the first
claim on this lake. Do not drink till you have answered
my questions," drinks notwithstanding, and
falls as if dead. At last Yudhishthira goes himself,
answers the questions, and is offered boons by the
sprite. He is very modest, and asks the life of one of
his two half-brothers only, not that of either of his full
brothers. Whereupon the sprite rewards his virtue by
bringing all four to life.</p>

<p>The riddles and questions are spun out at great
length, and many are palpable interpolations. A few
examples may be given. What is weightier (more reverend)
than the earth? One's mother. What is loftier
than the heavens? One's father. What is fleeter than
the wind? The mind. What are more numerous than
the blades of grass? Thoughts. What does not close
its eyes while asleep? A fish. What is that which
does not move after birth? An egg. What is that
which is without heart? A stone. And so on. A
paraphrase of parts of these chapters is given by Ed.
Arnold, Indian Idylls, Boston, 1883, pp. 212-235.</p>

<p>Similarly, in the Kath&#257;-sarit-s&#257;gara, chapter v, a man
escapes death by resolving an ogre's riddle. See Tawney's
translation, I, 26, and especially the note, where
Benfey is cited as comparing Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata, XIII,
5883 ff.</p>

<h4>4. Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight.</h4>

<p>P. 24. May Colvin in Ireland. According to a Connemara
story given briefly in Once a Week, II, 53 f,
July 2, 1864, one Captain Webb was wont to ill-use
young women, and then strip them and throw them into
the Murthering Hole, not far from Maarn. At last a
girl induced him to turn his back, and then thrust him
into the Hole. P. Z. Round.</p>

<p>24 b. The Flemish ballad is given by FÃ©tis, Histoire
GÃ©nÃ©rale de la Musique, V, 59, "d'aprÃ¨s un texte ancien
qui a deux strophes de plus que celui de Willems."
G. L. K.</p>

<p>28 b. 'Ãsu kvaeÃ°i' in Ãslenzk fornkvÃ¦Ã°i, II, 226, No
60, <b>A-M</b>: this copy <b>D</b> (<b>E-M</b>). Published in 1885.</p>

<p>41, and p. 487 f. Russian form, corrupted.</p>

<p>On the oaken bridge stood Galya, there Galya stood
and drew water, she drew water and spoke with Marko.
"O Marko mine, what dost thou say to me? Come
wander with me, youth; let us wander on foot through
the dark night." One field traversed, a second they
crossed, and in the third lay down on the grass to sleep.
The rain began to sprinkle, the fierce rain to fall, and
Marko began to slumber. "O Marko mine, sleep not
while with me; bare your sword and fight with me."
Young Galya vanquished Marko; she conquered Marko,
and rode, she mounted and rode over the level field.
Galya arrives at the new gate; there stands Marko's
mother, more beautiful than gold. "Young Galya,
what can I say? Have you seen Marko near my
house?" "Oh, hush, mother; weep not, mourn not.
Thy Marko has married in the field; he has taken to
himself a fine young lady, a grave in the meadow."
Trudy, V, 425, No 816.</p>

<p>A man beguiles a girl with tales of a land where the
rivers are of honey, where pears grow on willows, and
maidens are clothed in gold. Trudy, V, 335, No 660.</p>

<p>In one version of this ballad a cuckoo flies up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-497" id="Pg_2-497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
bids the maid not listen to the Cossack's tales: "I
have flown all over the world, and I have never seen
golden mountains, nor eaten pears from willow-trees,
nor beheld maidens clad in gold."</p>

<p>41 a, and 487 a. A maid going to the ford for water
meets Marko, and suggests that he should propose for
her; if her mother will not consent, they will roam.
They cross one field and two, and lie down on the grass
in a third. He is falling asleep, when she wakes him
with a cry that they are pursued. Marko is overtaken
and his head cut off. Trudy, V, 226, No 454. No
548, p. 278, is nearly the same. No 690, p. 352, resembles
in part No 454, and partly Golovatsky, I, 116.</p>

<p>42 a and 488 a, <b>A</b>. A lover takes his love by her
white hands, leads her to the Danube, seizes her by the
white sides, and flings her in. She asks whether she is
ugly, or whether it is her ill fate. Trudy, V, 166, No
339.</p>

<p>In PoÃ©sies pop. de la France, MS., VI, 278, PoÃ©sies
pop. de la CorrÃ¨ze, a ballad called 'Chanson du brave
Altizar' is mentioned as a variant of 'Dion et la Fille
du Roi,' and, fol. 321 of the same volume, a version from
Mortain, Basse Normandie, is said to have been communicated,
which, however, I have not found. These
may both belong with the French ballads at II, 356.</p>

<p>43 a. <b>E</b>. Another copy in Guillon, Chansons pop.
de l'Ain, p. 85.</p>

<p>Add <b>I</b>: 'Monsieur de Savigna,' Decombe, Chansons
pop. d'Ille-et-Vilaine, p. 264, No 92. The ballad begins
like <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, but the conclusion is inverted. The
fair one is thrown into a pond; M. Savigna cuts away
with his sword the plant she seizes when she comes up
from the bottom the fourth time; she asks, If you ever
go back, where will you say you left me? and he answers,
In the big wood full of robbers.</p>

who kill her husband, throw her child into the sea, and
act their pleasure with her. One of the nine, entering
into talk with the woman, discovers that she is his sister.

<p>238 b. A description of San Domingo de la Calzada,
with a narration of the miracle of St James, is cited by
Birlinger from a manuscript of travels by a young German,
1587-93, in Alemannia, XIII, 42-44. The traveller
had heard "the fable" in Italy, too, and had seen
a painting of it at Savona. R. KÃ¶hler.</p>

<p>De Gubernatis, ZoÃ¶logical Mythology, II, 283 f, note
2, after citing the legend of San Domingo de la Calzada,
adds: A similar wonder is said, by Sigonio, to
have taken place in the eleventh century in the Bolognese;
but instead of St James, Christ and St Peter
appear to perform miracles. G. L. K.</p>

<p>239. In The Ely Volume, or, The Contributions of
our Foreign Missions to Science, etc., 2d ed., Boston,
1885, the editor, Dr Laurie, discoursing of the Yezidees,
says they speak of Satan as Melek Taoos, King Peacock,
and the cawals (a sort of circuit-riders), "carry
round with them brazen images of a bird on a sort of
Oriental candlestick, as vouchers for their mission, and a
means of blessing to their followers. One of them gave
Dr Lobdell the following account of the origin of this
name [Melek Taoos]. In the absence of his disciples,
Satan, in the form of a dervish, took Christ down from
the cross and carried him to heaven. Soon after the
Marys came and asked the dervish where Christ was.
They would not believe his reply, but promised to do so
if he would restore the chicken he was eating to life.
He did so, and when he told them who he was they
adored him. When he left them he promised always
to appear to them as a beautiful bird, and so the peacock
became his symbol." P. 315. G. L. K.</p>

<p>A stunned white elephant will be resuscitated if
touched by the hand of a chaste woman. A king's
eighty thousand wives, and subsequently all the women
in his capital, touch the elephant without effect. A
serving-woman, devoted to her husband, touches the
elephant, and it rises in sound health and begins to eat.

of the Monferrato, communicated to me by Dr Ferraro,
a beautiful girl, when plucking up a cabbage, sees
under its roots a large room, goes down into it, and
finds a serpent there, who promises to make her fortune
if she will kiss him and sleep with him. The girl consents.
After three months the serpent begins to assume
the legs of a man, then a man's body, and finally
the face of a handsome youth, the son of a king, and
marries his young deliverer." De Gubernatis, ZoÃ¶logical

who is a maid by day and a serpent by night, and is
disenchanted by three kisses. G. L. K.</p>

<p>311. The Rev. Robert Lambe sent Percy, under date
of January 29, 1768, "the best copy of 'The Laidley
Worm' that he could procure from many incorrect, imperfect,
and nonsensical ones." There are differences
between this and the copy printed in Hutchinson,[188] but
one is about as good as the other. In this earlier copy
2 follows 3 and 37 is wanting. 6 and 7 read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O up then spake the queen herself:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who's this that welcoms me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lord replied, The king's daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flower of the North Country.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2-503" id="Pg_2-503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>
<p>And 17, 22:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He straightway built a bonny ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And set her on the sea;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Where there is rowan-tree wood.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Duncan Frasier does not appear in the last stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now this fact, as it happened, is<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For their good sung in rhime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest they should some important part<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forget of it in time.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Along with this earlier copy of Lambe's is found another,
undescribed, which shows both agreements and
variations: 2 follows 3, and 6, 7 and the final stanza
are the same. 17 and 22 are wanting, and there are,
therefore, no witches and no rowan-tree. Instead of
21-23, we have this very bad stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Run, run, my men, my sailors send<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Aboard yon ship so tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid them drown the Child of Wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he soon slew them all.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the same parcel there is a copy of 'The Laidley
Worm' which is somewhat more in the popular tone
than the one already printed. It was sent in an undated
letter [1775?] to J. Bulman, Esq., of Sheepwash,
Morpeth, by E. G., that is, Captain E. Grow.
"The above," says E. G., "is the Haggworm as I collected
it from an old woman. I wrote to the Revrd Mr
Lamb for his ballad, and directed him to send to you.... I
think the inclosed more original then his, for
Mr Lamb, tho a good antiquarian, is but a bad poet,
and above the one half is his own composing." Mr
J. Bulman appears to have transmitted this version to
Percy, to whom, upon another occasion, May 25, 1775,
he sends "a bold imitation of the song, now lost, of the
Laidler Worm (written by Duncan Frazier, the monk
on Cheviot, in 1270), by a lady, Miss Graham of Gloriorum,
in Northumberland:" of which nothing need be
said.</p>

turn into a salmon (SchnÃ¤pel) in the sea; he will give
chase in the form of a pike. She will become an ermine;
he an otter, and pursue her. She will fly off as
a lark; he will follow as an eagle. Here the talk of
transformation ends: Rune 37, vv. 148-178. The next

There is no occasion to accumulate examples, but this

riddles to GÃ´sht, and if GÃ´sht shall give no answer,
or say, I know not, he will slay him. After answering
all the riddles, GÃ´sht says he will give Akht three on
the same terms, and the sorcerer, failing to solve them,
is slain. Ar&#7693;Ã¢-VÃ®rÃ¢f, PahlavÃ® text, etc., Haug and West,
Bombay and London, 1872, pp. 250, 263 f. This tale
KÃ¶hler has shown to be one with that of the fine Kirghish

<p>Unterhaltende RÃ¤thsel-Spiele in Fragen u. Antworten,
gesammelt von C. H. W., Merseburg, 1824, has
the story of king, abbot, and shepherd, with the three
riddles, How far is it to heaven? How deep is the
sea? What is better than a gold coach? The shepherd
prompts the abbot, and the abbot answers the king
in person. The answer to the third is, the rain that
falls between Whitsuntide and St John's. For this reply

<p>Ferdinand Wolf, Jahrbuch fÃ¼r romanische und englische

in the eighteenth century, for representation by a

species of beetle is the Virgin's enemy, in place of the

SrÃ´sh, the pious, and ÃtarÃ´, the angel, said thus. This
river is the many tears which men shed from the eyes
as they make lamentation and weeping for the departed.
They shed those tears unlawfully, and they
swell to this river. Those who are not able to cross
over are those for whom, after their departure, much
lamentation and weeping were made, and those who
cross more easily are those for whom less was made.
Speak forth to the world thus: When you are in the
world, make no lamentation and weeping unlawfully;
for so, much harm and difficulty may happen to the
souls of your departed.</p>

<h4><a id="Transcribers_Notes"></a>Transcriber's Notes</h4>

<p>Page 20, Footnote <a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>: added missing closing quote and comma ('Sir Patrick
Spens', a piece of literary work of the last century,...)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-26">26</a>, stanza 13<sup>1</sup> changed "moo" to "moon" ('I saw the new moon late yestreen,)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-43">43</a>: changed comma to period (et estoit roy d'Angleterre.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-75">75</a>, stanza 11<sup>1</sup>: deleted erroneous comma at beginning of line (An she gid by the first table,)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-96">96</a>, heading to ballad version I: note that the balance of the date is missing in the original (learned from
his aunt at Old Deer, about 185)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-147">147</a>, ballad version C, stanza 14: added missing open quote ('Come doon, come doon, my pretty parrot,)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-164">164</a>, ballad version F, stanza 4: added missing open quote ('O wha is that at my bower-door,)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-206">206</a>: initial rough breathings before Greek capitals appear to have been
interpreted as opening single quotes, and the printer has supplied matching close
quotes. Both quotes and rough breathing are retained (... these also have: '<a title="[Gk: HÃª Eugenoula]">&#7977; &#917;&#965;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#945;</a>,'
'<a title="[Gk: Ho Charos kai hÃª KorÃª]">&#8009; &#935;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#953;
&#7969; &#922;&#959;&#961;&#951;</a>,' etc.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-228">228</a>: changed "be wailed" to "bewailed" (is bitterly bewailed by SigrÃºn.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-228">228</a>: changed closing single quote to double quote ("hon sÃ¶rjer sin
fÃ¤steman ur graf,")</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-231">231</a>, ballad version C, stanza 13: added missing open quote ('It is three hell-hounds, Marjorie,' he says,)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-240">240</a>: corrected reference "4<sup>2</sup>" to "4<sup>1</sup>" (So the "Sleep
you, wake you" of 4<sup>1</sup>,...)</p>

<p>Page 240, Footnote <a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>: changed "Madder" to "Madden" (As Sir Frederick Madden has observed,...)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-246">246</a>, heading to ballad version C changed "Roxburge" to "Roxburghe" (<b>d.</b> Roxburghe
Ballads, III, 340.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-284">284</a>, stanza 7: added missing close single quote (And bid Fair Eleanor come?')</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-285">285</a>, heading to ballad version B: deleted comma preceding semicolon (Motherwell's MS. p. 149;)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-294">294</a>, ballad version E, stanza 1<sup>3</sup>: suspect question mark may be a printer's error, but is retained (His lady, in her bigly bower?)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-295">295</a>: corrected stanza reference from "4" to "14" (14<sup>4</sup>. the door.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-366">366</a>, ballad version P, stanza 4<sup>3</sup>: added missing close single quote ('We'll nip the baby in the cradle,')</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-346">346</a>, changed "Series" to "eries" (<b>C.</b> Notes and Queries, Sixth Series,...)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-405">405</a>, note to ballad version B: changed "are" to italic (Quhat, ze, <i>etc., are printed</i> what, ye.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-405">405</a>, note on ballad version F stanza 16: italics extended to whole paragraph (16. <i>Given thus in Kinloch's annotated copy...
... and that of Buchan:</i>)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-406">406</a> changed "Islenzk" to "Ãslenzk" ('ÃiÃ°riks kvÃ¦Ã°i konÃºngs,' Ãslenzk
fornkvÃ¦Ã°i, II, 218, No 57, st. 6;)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-436">436</a>, stanza 55<sup>3</sup>: changed "Ihon" to "Iohn" (Thy brother Iohn shall be a lord,)</p>

<p>Page 494, Footnote <a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>: changed "ould" to "would" (and
would have followed No 40 had I known)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-513">513</a>, under notes on Ballad 78: original footnote reference, using "double dagger" symbol,
does not exist on page 236. The inference from context is that the reference should be to Footnote [134]
which originally had "dagger" symbol (236 b.... and to
note [134]., Jacobs, Anthologia GrÃ¦ca, II,...)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-515">515</a>: changed "8<sup>1</sup>" to "8<sup>2</sup>" (326, stanza 8<sup>2</sup>. _Read_ O go please it.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg_2-515">515</a>, under To be Corrected in the Print for Volume II, no instance
in the text could be found corresponding to the correction for Page
352, stanza 20<sup>2</sup>.</p>
